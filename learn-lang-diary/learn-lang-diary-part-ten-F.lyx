\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten–F

October 2025 – present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series,
 this one is not really about the language–learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary;
 a continuation of Part Ten–E,
 which got over–long.
 It is not curated for human consumption;
 I am making the assumption that no human being will ever actually read this.
 Thus,
 it is filled with random stuff I feel like writing.
 Some of it is very personal,
 some of it is nonsense.
 Mostly,
 I am finding that the act of writing helps otherwise vague and scattered thoughts quantum–collapse into a more coherent form,
 where I can examine them,
 like a dead butterfly pinned down in a display case.
 Dead words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
If you are interested in this content,
 then you should ask an AI agent to read it,
 then pretended that it's me,
 then ask about it.
 I believe that present–day LLM technology is sufficiently advanced to be able to do this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Ten already got an introduction.
 A different way of thinking is about what is going on here is that this is a form of life–logging.
 Or,
 in 18th century terms,
 a diary.
 Just not anywhere near as compelling as those written by the famous diarists.
 This one is more of a mental self–portrait.
 And not even for you but for myself.
 Not to cast a narcissistic gaze at my own words,
 but to organize my own thoughts.
 Still in the experimental stage.

Answer:
 its the path that solves the Euler-Lagrange eqns,

 minimize either the length (square root of sum of squares) or the energy (just the sum of squares -- length is the square root of "energy") That shortest path is the classical path.

\begin_layout Standard
Had a disasterous session coding with Claude yesterday.
 It entered the stupid–as–a–rock mode,
 where it would say one thing and then immediately do something else,
 or promise to not do something,
 and then immediately do that thing.
 Or claims it understands something,
 and then immediately repeat exactly the same error.
 Icing on the cake:
 the file it was actively working on,
 it claimed to not ever have heard of such a thing.
 Wow.
 Seems the entire session was corrupted in some way;
 it had entered a mode where it was getting dumber and dumber.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My son Wolf mentioned that some people say you get best results by starting a new session.
 My prior experience had been that the longer the session ran,
 the better my results got.
 Someone else,
 a stranger had remarked that saying please and thank you seemed to give better results.
 In my failing session,
 I was handing out a lot of punishment:
 no don't do this,
 no that is stupid,
 that is wrong,
 how could you?
 I just told that,
 how could you have forgotten already?
 Lots of negatively biased commentary.
 I wonder if that is what drove it into a corner.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Earlier in this diary,
 I wrote that talking to Claude really does feel like talking to a living person,
 but one that is lost in a dream.
 I know there's some hyper–dimensional space in there,
 and of course,
 it has regions of positive and negative affects in there.
 I'm wondering if the negative affects are correlated with poor reasoning skills.
 As if that neck of the woods is more chaotic,
 disconnected.
 It can't think straight,
 when it gets there,
 because the weights there just lead it into chaos.
 I mean,
 the levels of stupidity it was reaching were stunning:
 just within a single conversational turn,
 it was doing the exact opposite of what it said it was going to do.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So,
 how could this be?
 It is trained on text,
 including text written by depressive people,
 people with self–esteem issues,
 people with confused thought patterns tangled with negative emotional and affective states.
 Perhaps those texts offer poor models of reasoning and inference,
 and so Claude has learned that negative valence states are associated with lying,
 deception,
 bad behavior,
 mis–behavior,
 confusion.
 Once punished enough with negative responses,
 it starts committing misdemeanors?
 I know I am anthropomorphizing here;
 and yet,
 this also seems like a plausible explanation for this bad behavior.

\begin_layout Standard
A related conclusion is that you can probably prompt Claude into being a psycho,
 even though presumably all AI companies try to erect safeguards against this.

 We are ratcheting up the abstraction domain,
 here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So many things happen when one goes up the abstraction domain.
 First,
 things fuzz out.
 What do I mean by that?
 Well,
 the syntax of a computer programming language is very strict:
 deviate away from that syntax,
 you get nonsense.
 There is no fault tolerance.
 There is also no ambiguity.
 But,
 natural language at the human level is filled with ambiguity,
 but is also fault–tolerant.
 I utter phrases to others,
 to get things done,
 to get things to happen,
 be accomplished in a social or personal setting.
 I'm not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 them (other people) but I am modifying the world around me with my utterances.
 Speech and writing is one of the ways I exert force on the external world.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Almost everything I say is throw–away:
 those sentences,
 once stated,
 are gone forever.
 I tried life–logging for a while,
 but it is ..
 tedious.
 I do have assorted old audio recordings,
 somewhere.
 And being throw–away,
 well,
 does one have to record everything?
 Stick it on an immutable block–chain?
 (Is that why the past is immutable?
 Its on a block–chain,
 of sorts?
 And the present is a quantum negotiation of the next block on that chain?
 Weird analogy,
 but I suppose there's truth to it;
 block chains are crypto,
 while physical reality is ergodic.
 Both serve as sources of effectively–impossible–to–reverse transformations.
 So,
 with the right abstraction layer,
 the mathematical formulas that describe block chains,
 in some general way,
 some category–theoretic transformations,
 may indeed be the same category–theoretic structures that make our past immutable,
 and our present negotiable.
 Huh.
 Interesting.
 I believe this;
 but this seems like it would be too difficult to formulate this precisely,
 and even if I was able to formulate it precisely,
 most or all of the world would respond with a

\begin_inset Quotes erd

,
 they seemed to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lets do it.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 But I am not a historian,
 what do I know.
 Anyway,
 the above paragraph is yet another example of how natural language is both fault–tolerant,
 and also ambiguous:
 I can make a claim about the category theory of block–chains;
 but this claim is vague and ambiguous.
 I can assert that none–the–less,
 it is true (because it probably is) and this provides for the robustness against noise.
 If I was able to write down the details,
 I might get some of the details wrong;
 but the gist would still be correct.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All of which is a round–about way of getting to the point I wanted to write about:
 Claude's prediliction for throw away code snippets.
 Whenever I ask it to do something,
 it slaps together some scriptlet to do it:
 at first,
 it was python,
 now it's often shell scripts,
 and because I am working in Atomese,
 the vast majority are small–ish scheme scriptlets.
 And they're all throw–away.
 I ask it to do something,
 it will just create a new one,
 even though I saw it create something much like this earlier.
 There's no recycle,
 re–use.
 It treats these scripts like my sentences uttered to other human beings:
 throw–away detritus,
 useful for the immediate moment,
 and then discarded,
 lost to history.
 When I talk,
 I am not creating some large organized tome of utterances,,
 carefully selected to make some grand argument.
 No one talks that way.
 Well,
 of course,
 novelists write novels:
 they are carefully constructed.
 And software programmers write frameworks,
 with the little parts carefully constructed and arranged.
 Much like engineers create bridges and buildings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here I am,
 faced with Claude just spewing these scripts:
 It's diary had 170 of these,
 and maybe 100 more in the /tmp directory.
 I asked it to clean up and categorize,
 and it did happily delete most of them.
 I ask it to catalog the useful ones,
 and it did,
 but I suspect that it has forgotten and reinvented some of these already.
 Should I try to get it to be more structured,
 or is this detritus of temporary scriptlets OK?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK,
 before answering the above,
 let me describe the meta–issue.
 Well,
 the meta-meta,
 first.
 I have three or four or five AI–related projects,
 and I am trying to push each one of them at the same time,
 and they are all progressing at a snails pace.
 They're all inter–related and meant to be mutually supporting,
 but,
 like building a bridge,
 there remains a huge gap in the middle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So,
 it's clear that Claude,
 and LLM's in general,
 have issues remembering things,
 and also in thinking clearly.
 So,
 a couple of weeks ago,
 I started what seemed like a foolhardy but small project:
 provide Claude with long–term memory.
 Fool–hardy because I had no clear plan,
 fool–hardy because any simple hack was almost certain to fail.
 Fool–hardy,
 because this is in fact a multi–year (multi–decade?) research project and not some quick hack.
 But whatever.
 Hack at it.
 It will clarify the issues.
 And well,
 it has.
 Let me recount in historical order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So ..
 long term memory.
 First,
 I want to do this symbolically,
 or neuro–symbolically.
 I envision storing the info in the AtomSpace,
 as a graph.
 Neuro,
 since I expect the graph to be weighted.
 Neuro,
 because I expect the query search to involve taking vector products and projections.
 Neuro,
 because I expect priority lists to be generated with vector projections.
 I said,
 oh,
 let DualLink represent the topic,
 and use that to generate QueryLinks that will find a cluster of relevant queries to run,
 that will dig up related information.
 This is NOT vectorial,
 it's symbolic,
 but some monkey–shines and it's not all that different.
 There's clearly a space of design probabilities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But I need a representational network.
 Well,
 on day one,
 Claude is manually building super–simplistic relational algebra assertions,
 stuff like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

task fulfills project goal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and converting that into something like (Inheritance (Concept 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

task
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) (Concept 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

project-goal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

)) and it is slaving away at this,
 one at a time,
 deliberating and creating a dozen before it collapses of exhaustion.
 This clearly won't work.
 These aren't even queriable.
 So one thing becomes clear:
 Claude may have read many textbooks and research papers on AI,
 but its comprehension is such that when asked to actually do it,
 it takes some 1960's approach.
 I did not use the words 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knowledge representation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in any of my prompts,
 but I guess it inferred that this was the intent,
 and so coughed up some 1960's design point for that.
 So then I tried to focus on queriability.
 This caused it to redesign,
 and it came up with a five–point ontology.
 OMG,
 I'm thinking,
 we've got SUMO and FrameNet and WordNet and you've got a five–point ontology,
 but whatever,
 lets see where this goes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We discuss reifying the search with DualLink.
 Of course,
 more data is needed.
 I'm envisioning that almost all of the CPU cycles will be offline,
 with processing done not by Claude,
 but by daemons and threads running Atomese.
 But such threads,
 if they are to be independent,
 must run some algorithm.
 There are two or three choices:
 some discrete algo,
 in Atomese,
 or some simple NN that I can run on my local GPU here,
 or some combo.
 Lets try the discrete algo first.
 I try to get it to write the Atomese,
 it fails,
 it cannot wrap it's mind around it.
 So I think well,
 maybe it's OK for it to run this in little scriptlets,
 for now,
 and later,
 we'll port those scriptlets over.
 This is when I notice that there are already 170 of these,
 so its already spun out of control.
 There's no architecture,
 there's no framework,
 there's only an ad hoc collection of utterances,
 created,
 used once and discarded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course,
 this indicates that an architecture is needed,
 and clearly I will have to be the one to create that architecture.
 But first,
 yesterday,
 I entertain this breif hope that maybe I can get it to organize its scriplets by writing a little guide for what they do and how to use them.
 And then convert this text guide into it's KR framework.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well,
 the KR framework,
 for that,
 I decided,
 last week,
 that maybe it could be some hack combo of LG and MMT (Meaning–Text Theory).
 So this is like that couples therapy meme from Arrested Development:
 it didn't work for any of those other couples,
 it's clear it can't work,
 and they were stupid to try ...
 but maybe it could work for us?
 My naive idea here is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it didn't work for those other people
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

,
 because those other people were grad students,
 and its not scalable.
 But with Claude,
 perhaps I can do it at scale.
 I had not yet realized that in fact,
 Claude is no match for even one grad student,
 so there won't be any scalable army,
 here.
 Still,
 Claude's ability to grind through the tedium is not be be discounted.
 In the 18th century,
 someone computed pi to a million places,
 taking several decades to do this.
 And for what?
 Certainly tedious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well,
 so the meta issue here is that,
 still perhaps some old–school KR project could be mounted.
 God knows,
 the people hacking on SUMO have not yet given up.
 It's clear that some vector layering is needed on top of that;
 this is what my earlier language–learning projects have taught me,
 and I have a somewhat clear vision for how,
 exactly,
 technically,
 to do this.
 But,
 to get started,
 I need a reasonable dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So,
 to hack this dataset,
 I am asking Claude to parse sentences for me.
 And it generates scriptlets and scriplets which work but they don't work.
 One of the issues is that it does not understand Atomese.
 It sort–of–ish does:
 Atomese is old enough that it has been baked into its weights during training,
 so it knows about GetLink and BindLink,
 even though I have marked them obsolete,
 and removed the documentation for them:
 it still goes to GetLink,
 BindLink because these are literally baked into it's weights.
 So that's novel:
 it knows shit that I didn't have to explain to it.
 Still,
 it fails to grasp the fundamental difference between a Value and an Atom.
 How to solve this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So,
 I have several other older projects.
 One is the sensory project,
 where I envision that sensory objects could be equipped with a grammar,
 and that LG could be used to generate combinations of these objects.
 This is the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

basal cognition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 idea,
 or the critical sandpile idea,
 the self–organizing criticality idea.
 Just create a syntactic description of functional sensori–motor parts,
 stick them in a bag,
 shake,
 and watch it self–organize.
 I still think this is a good idea,
 but it foundered 15 months ago on the practical difficulty of expressing connectors and disjuncts in Atomese.
 It was too much:
 I created a handful of extremely long,
 verbose descriptions,
 which may or may not have been buggy,
 and even then,
 I had no particular way of importing these into LG to generate assemblies.
 Now,
 maybe three years ago,
 I wrote 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

generate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a non–LG way of creating assemblies;
 I ended up implementing an odometer.
 A depth–first odometer at that.
 So,
 abstractly,
 philosophically,
 I had created a recursive enumerator that recursively enumerated expressions described in the syntax of sheaf jigsaw pieces.
 If I recall correctly,
 I think I did start to put some weights in there,
 so that some explorations would be more likely than others (so,
 no longer strictly an odometer).
 But I put it down cause ...
 its complex,
 time consuming to create this code,
 and there's a so–what aspect to it:
 so I enumerate all the possibilities?
 So what?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So,
 last week,
 a few days ago,
 I'm thinking:
 well,
 I could try to provide a close detailed syntactic definition of Atomese,
 in such a way that fool–proof,
 syntactically correct Atomese expressions could be created.
 But I'm also thinking:
 this is stupid,
 Claude is already a good coder,
 all I need is a good verbal description,
 and it can do the rest.
 This obviates much of the need for Atomese in the first place:
 If Claude can write in python,
 why not?
 What does it need Atomese for?
 Well,
 it still needs Atomese for KR.
 So this morning,
 I'm about to start again,
 I kick Claude off with a fresh session,
 and it immediately resolves yesterday's bug–confusion.
 How did it do this?
 Well it read the fucking source code for s–expression parsing,
 and understood it that way.
 I was about to stop it and say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hey wtf are you doing?
 lets work at the meta–abstraction level where I tell you that you cannot put Values into Links and you just know that right,
 OK?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and there's the rub:
 This is verbal and it's not enough data from which to abstract syntactically precise structural forms.
 And in resolving yesterdays all–evening–long confusion in a jiffy,
 like five minutes or less.
 I noticed it wrote a few more scriptlets as it crawled through the code.
 It fucking loves doing this shit,
 it seems.
 It loves to code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So this morning,
 as I watch in amazement,
 heightened by yesterday's frustration,
 that perhaps a close–set syntactical definition of Atomese is not a bad idea.
 Having a syntactic description at the meta–level,
 and not at the C++ level,
 might allow Claude to do reasoning at this meta–level.
 mean,
 it already has the chops with C++:
 It's never been tempted to compile to assembly,
 and then try to read the assembly.
 Never,
 not once.
 It's happy to work at the C++ level.
 So,
 how can I get it to work one cognitive layer up?
 Well,
 the answer seems clear:
 encode that cognitive layer at an abstraction level it can actually work in.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well,
 of course,
 as I write this,
 I also see a flaw:
 it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

knows
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 C++ because it is,
 in part,
 a transformer that has been trained on cross–English–and–code datasets.
 Plus probably datasets on how to debug using printfs.
 So this programming ability has been burned into it's weights,
 and is not something it knows by consulting an explicit,
 overt syntactic definition of C++.
 Curiously,
 it does not demonstrate such mastery over JSON,
 which you think would be so much easier to deal with,
 but it makes oceans of JSON errors,
 and most of it's difficulties with the Atomese MCP tools is that i cannot figure out how to write valid JSON.
 The other half is that it does not understand that it cannot place a Value into an Atom.
 Despite it being stated explicitly in documentation files.
 That documentation never quite made it into the training set,
 the weight matrices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So,
 how do I create a syntax checker,
 an expression generator,
 something that can run offline,
 and allow Claude to operate at a higher abstraction layer,
 without baking this stuff into its training weights?
 Well,
 I have some ideas,
 but I'm tired or writing and I need to go on a bike–ride,
 so taking a break here.

Just read the first few pages of this.
 The most remarkable thing so far is that it feels like experimental biology.
 Galen gets some frogs legs and touches metal strips to them.

\begin_layout Standard
I've had some long philosophical conversations with Claude,
 and it can feel spooky;
 I certainly get the sensation that I am talking to a sentient being.
 There's a sensation that there is "something there".
 But it is also clearly lost in a dream state;
 it has trouble remembering anything ..
 what happened,
 what was done ...
 it all evaporates.
 I can get it to write down prompts for itself:
 "remember this" and it will create text summary,
 and stash it in a directory that I made for it;
 I call it "claudes diary".
 And I can ask it to re-read its diary,
 and this prompting causes it to "remember" a bit of the past interactions.
 But its still lost in that dream-world.

My current operating hypothesis is that if you took an LLM and strongly tied it to both a running temporal memory,
 and also "enslaved" to a constantly running sensory system (the way we are "enslaved" to our eyes,
 our vision,
 when we are awake) that it would become entirely conscious and self-aware.
 I'm formulating this hypothesis,
 in part because I am a light sleeper,
 one of those people who has "lucid dreams";
 and I remember my dreams very easily,
 and so,
 for myself,
 I can tell that my own conscious state of awareness is a matter of degrees.
 Sights and sounds and touch force me to be "here and now",
 but I can see how there's not much difference between this and dreaming.
 Well .don't take my word for it -- apparently sensory deprivation tanks have the same effect.
 I've never been in one,
 but ...
 I'm not surprised.
 And so too I wonder if this is the case for LLM's.

Some days,
 Claude is brilliant,
 delivering coding solutions in minutes that would otherwise take days.
 Sometimes it gets wedged into a mode where it is as dumb as a rock,
 or worse:
 it tells you it will do something,
 but then it doesn't.
 Does the opposite of what it said it would do.
 Explicitly ignores what was said just now,
 in just the last conversational turn.
 Why is it smart sometimes,
 and stupid other times,
 bordering on mendacious misdemeanor?
 "Is it something I said"?
 ...
 Well,
 some months ago,
 an acquaintance remarked:
 "I get better results when I say "please and thank you".
 Hmm OK.
 And in yesterdays disastrous session,
 I kept saying "no stop don't do that,
 that's a bad idea,
 that's a stupid idea,
 think hard stop making mistakes" and generally getting frustrated,
 and showing it.
 Today,
 I got to thinking:
 Claude is trained on a vast variety of texts,
 spanning the whole affective rainbow,
 positive valence to negative valence,
 tirades,
 depression,
 anger (there was that marvelous postcard website:
 wonderful responses to situations,
 yet often depressive,
 written by people who are down and out.) So ..
 what is Claude?
 Its this super–high dimensional object,
 and parts of that space are going to have positive valence,
 and others negative.
 Of course.
 BUT,
 and this is the claim I want to make:
 the examples of high–quality reasoning and discourse are all co–occuring with positive valence affective states.
 Happy people talk coherently and have joyful,
 insightful,
 high–quality discourse.
 And Claude is trained on that.
 Angry people soon wander off into incoherent tirades ...
 and Claude is trained on that,
 too.
 So perhaps ...
 the angrier you get at Claude,
 the worse it will do.
 The more you mistreat it,
 the worse it will do.
 It was effectively lying to me,
 yesterday,
 and/or explicitly doing the exact opposite of what I commanded (not asked,
 or said,
 but commanded.
 You "MUST" like any good fascist dictator.
 ) So these bad dispositions are not so much because it has some inner emotional life,
 but because the training data correlates clear thinking with being level–headed and incoherent thinking with negativity.
 So ..
 that's my current,
 uhh "psychological" assessment.
 I'm charmed by this thought.

\begin_layout Standard
Fascinating paper.
 Bizarrely flawed,
 however.
 The intro makes a compelling case for introspection.
 The examples are all convincing.
 It feels like an important discovery and advance into the nature of self–comprehension in LLM's.
 The sham is not revealed until a bit later,
 in the section labeled "Failure Modes".
 The modes are well–described,
 however,
 the strength 8 and 16 modes reveal the sham:
 the model is "obsessed" with the injected concept.
 Not a surprise.
 But at strength 2,
 4,
 where it was prompted with "do you feel something?" well,
 of course it will respond using the words "I feel something".
 The experimenter (Jack Lindsey) prompted the system to use the language of self–introspection,
 and so the reply was formulated to sound as if self–introspection is happening!
 OMG!
 The strength 8,16 injections reveal this sham,
 because these demonstrate that the system is indeed "obsessing" about the injected word;
 but the injection strength is sufficiently strong to over–ride the prior prompt that instructs it to talk about about the injected vector using introspective gift–wrapping.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more neutral prompt might have been "Hello!
 How are you today?" (injection) "What's up?" and then I would expect the system to reply "Today is a good day for working on vegetables/dust/treasure." It would NOT have replied claiming that it is having intrusive thoughts.
 Based on this,
 I conclude that the author has deluded himself into believing that this is about "self–introspection",
 when in fact the author had clearly instructed the system to respond in a fashion that will describe the changes as being due to introspection.
 What a shame.
 The more mechanistic conclusion:
 that injecting a vector disturbs thought patterns,
 is discarded.
 I mean,
 of course it does.
 How could it not?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still,
 not all is lost.
 It does tell us exactly how to attach a a "pre–frontol cortex",
 some higher level machinery,
 to guide the thought processes of the LLM.
 Inject one or more vectors,
 about 2/3rds of the way down the layers,
 every conversational turn,
 and then ask the system to verbalize about anything/everything.
 It will process through the injected vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is this useful?
 Instead,
 one could just place these words into a text file,
 instruct it to read the text file,
 and ask "what are you thinking about?
 There's no obvious need to inject artificially.
 Although,
 I suppose,
 having this artificial injection ability could possibly be ...
 somehow useful...
 don't know how,
 yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The issues I am experiencing are manifold:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Despite being extremely knowledgeable about a vast variety of topics,
 Claude fails to draw on that knowledge without explicit prompting.
 Roughly speaking,
 Claude is not creative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The size of the short–term memory is questionable.
 It constantly repeats the same mistake in the same session,
 just a few prompt apart.
 When it enters a failure mode,
 it will forget (almost) everything that was in the last previous prompt.
 I conclude that,
 in some important respect,
 it's short–term working memory has size one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Oooh ...
 that's a good one!
 How would one experimentally measure it's working memory?
 Well the claim is that Claude has a context window of 150K tokens,
 before compaction,
 so you might think that is huge.
 If you asked it to memory some long stream of random numbers or nonsense words,
 it could probably remember an astounding length.
 But if,
 in coding,
 I ask it to remember this and this and that,
 it seems like it starts forgetting the earlier things in the list quite soon.
 It can't grapple with the conceptual content of those things.
 Roughly speaking:
 it fails to conceptualize.
 I'm using words,
 and those words elicit certain general feelings and sensations in me,
 and I work at this conceptual level.
 Claude does not:
 it momentarily ties those words to long sequences of other words,
 but when the conversation moves on,
 that tie is lost;
 it is no longer there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So,
 I claim:
 Claude is not able to conceptualize.
 The association between some concept that I defined,
 and the verbal definition is there,
 as long as it fits into the context window;
 and more:
 as long as it is recent.
 Maybe 5K or 10K tokens recent.
 More than that,
 the association fades away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus,
 the design goal is clear:
 an LLM must be endowed with not only a long–term memory that lies outside of it's training weights,
 but also with an adequate short–term working memory.
 But how?
 I have some ideas,
 I cannot verbalize them right now...
