\begin_layout Title
Language Learning Diary - Part Five
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
Jan 2022 - March 2022
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The language-learning effort involves research and software development
 to implement the ideas concerning unsupervised learning of grammar, syntax
 and semantics from corpora.
 This document contains supplementary notes and a loosely-organized semi-chronol
ogical diary of results.
 The notes here might not always makes sense; they are a short-hand for
 my own benefit, rather than aimed at you, dear reader!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part Five of the diary on the language-learning effort continues work on
 the English dataset.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good progress was made.
 It appears that we have a high-quality, stable, debugged clustering algorithm
 in place, and it is generating good-quality clusters.
 However, dozens of questions and hypothesis arise, which is a bit overwhelming.
 The lack of any kind of theoretical foundations for any of this stuff is
 frustrating.
 Without theory, it is hard to get strong insight.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, results seem solid enough that we can now move on to the next
 steps of the program.
 I'm hoping to start work on multi-sentence and cross-paragraph correlations
 in the coming months.
 Although, before doing this, perhaps a comparison to the hand-built LG
 grammars is in order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Summary Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A summary of what is found in this part of the diary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From Experiment-10: Ranked-MI (Variational MI) seems to mostly make good
 cluster recommendations, except when it doesn't.
 Since the actual merge proceeds via a Jaccard-type voting in of disjuncts,
 it is possible that the poor recommendations results in few contributions.
 But there is no obvious way to automate a quality measurement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From Experiment-10: A list of the first 31 clusters is presented.
 It seems OK but not great.
 Hard to say, as the Jaccard-selection mechanism selects membership, and
 we don't have a window into that.
 Is there a way of visualizing the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

word-sense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a cluster?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From Experiment-10: A fairly large number of merges are expanding or merging
 prior classes.
 This suggests that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

preferential attachment
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is hard at work, and so we should not be surprised to later observe scale-free
 results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
This implies that ranked-MI/variational-MI automatically, inherently makes
 these kind of preferential-attachment suggestions.
 How does this work? What are the details? Are there alternatives?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As clustering proceeds, there are several dozen different measurements and
 indicator values that can be tracked, including the dataset entropy, the
 MMT-Q value, the size of clusters, the ranked-MI of the top-ranked word-pair,
 and so on.
 Many graphs of these indicators are presented.
 Experiment-10 tracks four of these; experiments 11 and 12 tracks dozens
 of them.
 A significant portion of the parameter space is explored.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Graphs of the word-disjunct marginal entropy distribution is presented.
 This for the dataset, before clustering is started.
 It appears to be a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Multiple alternatives to the variational-MI (ranked-MI) are proposed and
 developed.
 These are computed for the top-200 most common words in the dataset (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(N+1\right)/2$
\end_inset

 word-pairs, for 
\begin_inset Formula $N=200$
\end_inset

.) Although they make different ranking recommendations, the overall distribution
s are nearly identical.
 Although roughly Gaussian, these have a very fat tail to the left (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 on the negative side: they find a lot of dis-similarity.) The fat tail is
 hypothesized to be driven by the number of distinct word-senses (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 word-senses should be dis-similar.) All of these alternatives are more computati
onally intensive than the ranked-MI, and thus are not really practical to
 apply.
 It is hypothesized that all of these might still end up selecting the same
 in-group (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 although the top-ranked pairs differ, the in-groups would not.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
From Experiment-11: The top ranked-MI pair is used to form the initial seed
 of a cluster, and then the regular MI is used to nominate additional members.
 When the Jaccard overlap of the nominees is computed, it is surprisingly
 low.
 Why? Is it because MI is pair-wise, and Jaccard is group-wise?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Despite the low overlap, the majority of sections get merged, only because
 their counts are below the noise-floor.
 How do low-count disjuncts influence the MI?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Setting the noise-floor causes disjuncts with a count below this floor to
 be swept up into the group.
 Later, during the preferential attachment and growth of groups, is it possible
 that this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 hijacks the initial cluster, twisting it in a different direction from
 where it started? Is it causing the signal to be washed out? What happens
 if we set the noise-floor to zero?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
After running the algo for about 1060 steps, about 530 word-classes were
 created (the fact that its about a half is unexplained, but gives a hint
 of the role of preferential attachment).
 When comparing the 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(N-1\right)/2$
\end_inset

 class-pairs (for 
\begin_inset Formula $N=530)$
\end_inset

, about 93% of them have a similarity of zero: that is, they are completely
 orthogonal.
 That's a good thing: we wanted to have classes that are distinct from one-anoth
er, and that is what we are getting.
 Of the remaining 7%, the distribution of MI is almost perfectly a Gaussian,
 centered at about MI of negative 3, and an stddev of 3.5.
 Negative MI is also good: it means that even if they are not perfectly
 orthogonal, they are almost-so.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The above stands in contrast to the word-word orthogonality of the remaining
 (as yet unmerged) words: more than 80% of them have a non-zero similarity.
 The distribution of these is almost Gaussian, with a bit of a fat tail
 towards the low-end.
 Compared to the pre-merge MI distribution, there is little change, except
 perhaps in the fat tail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That pretty much wraps things up for this chapter.
 Merge experiments are ongoing, and further results will be presented in
 later diary chapters.
 I don't expect many changes from the above; just some longer runs with
 maybe clearer results.
 A noise=0 run is clearly called for.
 Examining orthogonality as a function of time is also interesting, to be
 reported later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
TODO
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A list of things to do, here or later:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In population genetics, a neutral evolutionary model with a static population
 size results in a power-law distribution of alleles in the population.
 Can this process model also explain the power-law (Zipfian, square-root-Zipfian
) distributions seen elsewhere? There is a similar set of results in ecology,
 with regards to species distribution in an ecological niche.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Expt-10 Merge exploration (Jan 2022)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The end of Diary Part Four describes a dataset with several thousand merged
 words in it.
 However, that dataset had assorted issues, and recreating it before investing
 time in characterizing it seems like a good idea.
 There were numerous (and ongoing) bug-fixes made.
 Phew.
 5 Jan 2022 Looks like the last of the bugs are now fixed.
 This took two weeks of very tedious debugging.
 Ouch.
 Ready to restart, at last.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we are ready, the questions below arise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Things worth exploring.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What have we actually got? Some questions about the dataset:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Distribution: size of word-class vs.
 rank.
 This was previously examined in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

diary part one
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, page 99, for a different collection of merge algorithms (and earlier,
 different datasets).
 Do we still get something similar?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Above, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

size
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

number of words in the word-class
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or it might mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

number of disjuncts in word-class
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or it might mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

number of disjuncts in word-class with count weighting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Oof.
 It would be nice to have a dashboard for this, instead of lots of manual
 work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Distribution of word-senses.
 That is, how many words participate in more than one word-class? If they
 do participate in more than one word-class, what is the weight in each
 class?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For words that belong to word-classes, what fraction of their weight remains
 unassigned to any word-class?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Distribution of MI of pairs of word-classes.
 We might hope that this is low, so that different word-classes are different
 from one another.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Distribution of self-MI of word-classes.
 One might hope that this is high, so that the word-classes do not share
 much in common with other words or word-classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As above, but distribution of MI of pairs consisting of a word-class, and
 a word.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Prior to starting the merge, there's an MI between words and disjuncts.
 I don't recall examining that in detail, before.
 Then, after the merge, how does this change?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That's a lot of questions.
 Not clear which ones should be answered first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Round 43
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Done with bug-fixing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm currently using `
\family sans
r9-sim-200.rdb
\family default
` for marginals plus the similarities for the top 200 most frequent words.
 Then run 
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

cp -pr r9-sim-200.rdb r10-merge.rdb
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

guile -l cogserver-gram.scm
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

(in-group-cluster covr-obj 0.5 0.2 4 200 100)
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This works great until merge 43 where we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

------ Round 43 Next in line: ranked-MI = 5.6267 MI = 5.1464 (`could must
 would should may will can might`, `to`)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

In-group size=5: `to` `could must would should may will can might` `you`
 `I` `we`
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So that looks like a bug.
 Issues:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Hard to believe that this is the top ranked-MI pair.
 
\end_layout

\begin_deeper
\begin_layout Itemize
Is the MI being computed correctly? It almost surely is, but still ...
 ??
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Should the ranked-MI for a cluster be de-rated, say, by the number of words
 in the cluster?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The next 10 highest ranked-MI merges look great! So maybe somehow the ranked
 MI for clusters is wrong?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Since merging is via a Jaccard-overlap selection mechanism, perhaps most
 of the contributing disjuncts in the bad recommendations will be ignored?
\end_layout

\end_deeper
\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Separator plain
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Round 88 - Majority voting bug?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Subsequent merges look ..
 pretty good, except when they don't, and then they look ugly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At round 88 it goes nuts: it merges a few disjuncts of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As as
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 together.
 Then it merges zero of them into 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

As as.i
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and then hits an inf loop, because what is left after the merge still
 has a high MI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conclude: the majority-voting scheme left behind (left unmerged) too much;
 enough that the MI between what is left is still high.
 Can we redefine the voting procedure to lessen this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Bug Fixes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There were multiple bugs, difficult to locate.
 Some cross-section merges were being done wrong.
 A bug in cog-delete! was erasing data in DB, thus restarts loaded missing/corru
pt data.
 As of 15 Jan all seems to be fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Round 31
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After fixes, the first 31 rounds merge the following words.
 The is with quorum=0.5 commonality=0.2 noise=4.

Notable is that a fairly large number of merges are expanding or merging
 prior classes.
 This is curious.
 This suggests that

 is hard at work, and so we should not be surprised to later observe scale-free
 results.

This implies that ranked-MI/variational-MI automatically, inherently makes

 How does this work? What are the details? Are there alternatives?

Regarding the mediocre merge suggestions: The Jaccard-selection mechanism
 selects membership, and we don't have a window into that.
 Its possible that the mediocre merge recommendations work out so that very
 few disjuncts get merged into the final cluster.

Also being tracked, per merge: rows, cols, lcnt, rcnt, size, sparsity, entropy,
 ranked-mi, mmt-q.
 These look good, up to round 28, when lcnt=0, size=0 and some divide-by-zero
 garbage up the other stats! After that point, the lcnt off by a little
 bit.

\begin_layout Standard
At the conclusion of round 27, mmt-q=+inf.0 is already wrong.
 But this value gets recorded as part of round 28.

Spot sampling of the merges looks much like the above: some pretty good-looking
 merges interspersed with some head-scratchers.
 This occasional ugliness continues deeply into the merge stream.
 What is not clear is how many disjuncts are involved in the uglies, and,
 if they occur early, exactly how much 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

noise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 they carry away.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What does come clear from the spot inspection is that ranked-MI is starting
 to make some pretty poor recommendations.
 Basically, the clusters get an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unnaturally
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 large ranked-MI, because they are so large, even though the raw MI to what
 is being suggested is relatively low.
 That is, the use of ranked-MI is the reason why the clusters grow preferentiall
y.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this round, four stats are tracked: the dataset sparsity, the dataset

The ranked-MI of the next pair to merge drops, because, naturally, the highest-r

 It spiked whenever a large cluster is created: the shear size of this cluster
 guarantees that it will have a large ranked-MI, irrespective of the absolute-MI.

 is being used as a

 The definition was the log of the sum-squared marginals:

\end_inset

This is

There seems to be a big changes in the quorum=0.7 curve, just before the
 800'th merge.
 Unfortunately, this code failed to track the merged words, so unclear what
 that's about.

\begin_layout Standard
Other issues: the above run fails to compute the marginals correctly, and
 thus some of the similarities could easily be off.
 This particular bug is fixed, and a newer run is presented further below.

Notes:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The quorum=0.8 run died prematurely, after performing 986 merges.

 Below, we explore a bit more in that vein, that apparently was not previously
 explored.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Diary Part Three we looked at the word-rank vs.
 support (page 10).
 Here, we look at rank vs.
 right-entropy and rank vs.
 right-MI as well as rank vs log-probability.
 The goal of asking these questions is two-fold.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The current merge algo uses ranked-MI to select the next word-pair to anchor
 a merge.
 Perhaps some other linear combination of MI and, say, right-entropy might
 be better?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The current merge algo uses a majority-voting scheme, by computing an overlap.
 Perhaps some log-overlap, of some word-disjunct MI would be better?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, these relationships seem interesting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Definitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some definitions are in order.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The definitions here are the same as given in earlier texts.
 The code that implements these was developed primarily in 2017, and can
 be found in the `opencog/matrix` subdirectory of the git repo at 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "AtomSpace"
target "https://github.com/opencog/atomspace/tree/master/opencog/matrix"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 See, in particular, `frequency.scm` and `entropy.scm`.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 This repeats definitions given earlier.
 For a word-disjunct pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 the frequentist probability is 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(w,d\right)=N\left(w,d\right)/N\left(*,*\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Since it has two arguments, this can be called the 'joint probability'
 or 'joint frequency'.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Total and Marginal Entropies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The total entropy is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H=H_{\mbox{tot}}=-\sum_{w,d}P\left(w,d\right)\log_{2}P\left(w,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

The right-marginal entropy for a given word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h_{\mbox{right}}\left(w\right)=-\sum_{d}P\left(w,d\right)\log_{2}P\left(w,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

The fractional right-marginal entropy for a given word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{\mbox{right}}\left(w\right)=\frac{h_{\mbox{right}}\left(w\right)}{P\left(w,*\right)}
\]

\end_inset

The goal of the division by the marginal probability 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(w,*\right)$
\end_inset

 of the word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is to rescale the entropy into a sensible range.
 For the current dataset, this is in the range of 5 to 25, as graphed below.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{\mbox{left}}\left(d\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\mbox{left}}\left(d\right)$
\end_inset

 for disjuncts 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

are defined likewise.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{\mbox{tot}}=\sum_{w}P\left(w,*\right)H_{\mbox{right}}\left(w\right)=\sum_{d}P\left(*,d\right)H_{\mbox{left}}\left(d\right)
\]

\end_inset

can be used as a consistency check on the numerical results.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The marginal probabilities also allow two more kinds of entropies to be
 defined.
 These are the left and right entropies of the left and right marginal probabili
ties: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{\mbox{right}}=\sum_{w}P\left(w,*\right)\log_{2}P\left(w,*\right)
\]

\end_inset

and likewise 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{\mbox{left}}=\sum_{d}P\left(*,d\right)\log_{2}P\left(*,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

One might argue that the names 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

left
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are incorrectly interchanged in the above, but this is the naming convention
 used in the implementation, and changing it risks introducing bugs and
 confusion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These two are related to the total mutual information (as defined below)
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{\mbox{tot}}=S_{\mbox{right}}+S_{\mbox{left}}-H_{\mbox{tot}}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Total and Marginal Mutual Information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mutual information for a word-disjunct pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
mi\left(w,d\right)=P\left(w,d\right)\log_{2}\frac{P\left(w,d\right)}{P\left(*,d\right)P\left(w,*\right)}
\]

\end_inset

As always, the fractional MI is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI\left(w,d\right)=\frac{mi\left(w,d\right)}{P\left(w,d\right)}
\]

\end_inset

thus scaling it into a sensible range of -5 to +20, as shown below.
 The marginals proceed likewise, as above, so that the right marginal 
\begin_inset Formula $mi$
\end_inset

 for word 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
mi_{\mbox{right}}\left(w\right)=mi\left(w,*\right)=\sum_{d}mi\left(w,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

and the fractional right marginal mutual information is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{\mbox{right}}\left(w\right)=\frac{mi_{\mbox{right}}\left(w\right)}{P\left(w,*\right)}
\]

\end_inset

The grand-total MI for the dataset is
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI=MI_{\mbox{tot}}=\sum_{w,d}mi\left(w,d\right)=\sum_{w}P\left(w,*\right)MI_{\mbox{right}}\left(w\right)=\sum_{d}P\left(*,d\right)MI_{\mbox{left}}\left(d\right)
\]

\end_inset

As noted earlier, the mutual information is minus the total entropy, up
 to entropies of the marginal probabilities:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{\mbox{tot}}=S_{\mbox{right}}+S_{\mbox{left}}-H_{\mbox{tot}}
\]

\end_inset

 We begin with a very conventional graph, and a very conventional result.
 This shows the marginal frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(w,*\right)$
\end_inset

 as a function of the rank.
 The distribution is almost Zipfian, with a classical Zipf slope.
 It's a bit noisier than hoped for; the noise may be due to the somewhat
 imperfect dataset (it contains a lot of words with escaped backslashes
 in them, due to a very early parsing bug.)

This fit is not particularly convincing; there's a sharp drop-off to the
 right that is not being fit.
 The data is fairly noisy.
 My guess is that the spiky bits on the right are from infrequently-observed
 word-disjunct pairs.

This suggests redoing the bin-counts, weighting each word by it's probability.
 This is shown below.

 This makes it clear that the right side of the picture, the high entropy
 side, is associated with infrequent words.

Also, this time, the Gaussian is an excellent fit.
 Note that the Gaussian is centered on

 This is as it should be: the total entropy is the average of this distribution.

It seems reasonable to expect a Gaussian distribution here, also, but it

 A log-linear fit seems better.
 It's not clear whether this should be dismissed as

 or not.
 Note that the Gaussian is centered on 
\begin_inset Formula $MI_{\mbox{tot}}=5.5865$
\end_inset

.
 The histogram has been manually checked, and integrates to this same value.
 That is might be the case is not obvious in this semi-log plot, but the
 very high frequency of values 
\begin_inset Formula $MI<5$
\end_inset

 is enough to balance the long tail on the right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Scatter-plots

\begin_layout Standard
How does the MI correlate with the entropy and the frequency? Three scatter-plot

\end_inset

 vs.
 the log of the marginal frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}P\left(w,*\right)$

.
 The two straight lines have the slopes as indicated, and approximately
 bound the distribution.

\end_inset

 vs.
 the log of the marginal frequency 
\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}P\left(w,*\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Again, two lines approximately bound the distribution.
 Note that the average MI of this distribution is 
\begin_inset Formula $MI_{\mbox{tot}}=5.5865$
\end_inset

 Thus, we have a very long tail offsetting a very heavy low-MI, high-frequency
 stub.

\begin_inset Formula $-\log_{2}P\left(w,*\right)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{\mbox{right}}=8.5148$

\begin_layout Subsection*
Alternative Rankings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Diary Part Three proposes that two words should form the seed of a cluster,
 if they have the largest ranked-MI of all word-pairs.
 Can the above provide some alternative rankings? First, recall the definition
 of the ranked-MI.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Ranked-MI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following is a quick recap of the ranked-MI, as discovered and developed
 in Parts Three and Four of the Diary.
 The ranked-MI was built out of the common-MI plus Q, as follows.
 Specifically, this repeats and condenses the content of Part Three, pages
 18-19, as well as Diary Part Four, page 19.
 Start by defining 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 as the observation count on the word-disjunct pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

.
 From this, the observation frequency follows as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P\left(w,d\right)=\frac{N\left(w,d\right)}{N\left(*,*\right)}
\]

\end_inset

The joint frequency of two words 
\begin_inset Formula $w,u$
\end_inset

 is then defined as the matrix product
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(w,u\right)=\sum_{d}P\left(w,d\right)P\left(u,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

This is not normalized, in that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(*,*\right)\ne1$
\end_inset

 which leads to the definition of
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q=-\log_{2}f\left(*,*\right)=-\log_{2}\sum_{d}P\left(*,d\right)P\left(*,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

which has a value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=11.945777$
\end_inset

 for this dataset.
 Note the minus sign.
 This means 
\begin_inset Formula $1\gg f\left(*,*\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The marginals can then be derived as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f\left(w\right)=f\left(w,*\right)=\sum_{d}P\left(w,d\right)P\left(*,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

The word-pair MI is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI\left(u,w\right)=\log_{2}\frac{f\left(w,u\right)f\left(*,*\right)}{f\left(w\right)f\left(u\right)}
\]

\end_inset

Note the definition above is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

projective
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that it is independent of the overall normalization of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 This is seen explicitly, by expanding out:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
MI\left(u,w\right)= & \log_{2}\frac{\left[\sum_{d}P\left(u,d\right)P\left(w,d\right)\right]\left[\sum_{d}P\left(*,d\right)P\left(*,d\right)\right]}{\left[\sum_{d}P\left(u,d\right)P\left(*,d\right)\right]\left[\sum_{d}P\left(w,d\right)P\left(*,d\right)\right]}\\
= & \log_{2}\frac{\left[\sum_{d}N\left(u,d\right)N\left(w,d\right)\right]\left[\sum_{d}N\left(*,d\right)N\left(*,d\right)\right]}{\left[\sum_{d}N\left(u,d\right)N\left(*,d\right)\right]\left[\sum_{d}N\left(w,d\right)N\left(*,d\right)\right]}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The ranked-MI is defined as 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mbox{ranked}MI\left(w,u\right)= & MI\left(u,w\right)+\frac{1}{2}\log_{2}f\left(u\right)+\frac{1}{2}\log_{2}f\left(w\right)+Q\\
= & \log_{2}\frac{f\left(w,u\right)}{\sqrt{f\left(w\right)f\left(u\right)}}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Just like the MI, the ranked-MI is scale invariant; its projective.
 This suggests that it has some interesting theory behind it.
 Graphs for the ranked-MI for this dataset can be found at the end of Part
 Three.
 They are pretty Gaussians.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Probabilities over Word Pairs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ratio
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\pi\left(u,w\right)=\frac{f\left(w,u\right)}{f\left(*,*\right)}
\]

\end_inset

is a probability.
 Thus, we can play the game again, this time with 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 and ask about conditional probabilities, mutual information and entropies.
 For example, what is the value of
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
RMI_{\mbox{tot}}=\sum_{w,u}\pi\left(w,u\right)\log_{2}\frac{\pi\left(w,u\right)}{\sqrt{\pi\left(w\right)\pi\left(u\right)}}
\]

\end_inset

This and related questions have to stay out of reach, however, since computing
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi\left(u,w\right)$
\end_inset

 for all word-pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(u,w\right)$
\end_inset

 is computationally infeasible at this time.
 (Well, it could be done 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

easily
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on a cloud instance with a few hundred CPU's, but I don't have that, or
 even the code to leverage that.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Alternative Rankings
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Following the above, several variations suggest themselves: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
HMI\left(u,w\right)=MI\left(u,w\right)+\frac{1}{2}H_{\mbox{right}}\left(u\right)+\frac{1}{2}H_{\mbox{right}}\left(w\right)
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MMI\left(u,w\right)=MI\left(u,w\right)+\frac{1}{2}MI_{\mbox{right}}\left(u\right)+\frac{1}{2}MI_{\mbox{right}}\left(w\right)
\]

\end_inset

Either of these feel like promising improvements to ranked-MI, as, experimentall
y, ranked-MI is proving to be less than reliable for merge determinations.
 As mentioned earlier, the core problem is that ranked-MI seems to be suggesting
 that clusters should be merged far too often, presumably because 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}\log_{2}f\left(w\right)$
\end_inset

 gets larger and larger as the clusters grow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Neither of the above have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pretty
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 interpretations, which can be seen by recalling the definitions above:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H_{\mbox{right}}\left(w\right)=-\frac{\sum_{d}P\left(w,d\right)\log_{2}P\left(w,d\right)}{P\left(w,*\right)}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
and
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
MI_{\mbox{right}}\left(w\right)=\frac{1}{P\left(w,*\right)}\sum_{d}P\left(w,d\right)\log_{2}\frac{P\left(w,d\right)}{P\left(*,d\right)P\left(w,*\right)}
\]

\end_inset

These are less compelling because of this complexity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Alternative Similarity Distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We previously saw that common-MI had a nice Gaussian distribution.
 Is this still the case for HMI and MMI? Lets find out ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Part Three, the graphs were done with a set of similarities for the top
 1200 words, computed without shapes.
 What I have handy for the current dataset is much smaller: just the top
 200 most frequent words; however, this time, similarities were computed
 using shapes.
 So its ..
 different.
 Anyway, there's a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(N+1\right)/2=20100$
\end_inset

 similarities handy.
 Of these, 175 do not have an MI; that is, the dot-product is zero, so the
 MI is 
\begin_inset Formula $-\infty$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, only 20100-175=19925 actual pairs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Four nearly identical graphs, differing only in the horizontal offset:

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gaussians are an eyeballed fit.
 Perhaps there are some popular fat-tailed distributions that would give
 a better fit? At any rate, the fat-tail is on the left, an excessive of
 word-pairs judged to be dis-similar.
 Perhaps this is a good thing? That is, the MPG parsing gave us a bunch
 of disjuncts that are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

obviously
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dis-similar, which is exactly what we hope to see.
 Perhaps the fatness of the tail is correlated with the number of distinct
 word-senses? That is, we expect words with different word-senses to be
 dis-similar to one-another, and so the more word-senses there are, the
 fatter the tail? What is the theoretical exposition for this effect?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How similar are these graphs? All four are re-plotted below, with the horizontal
 offset adjusted by the eyeballed fits, above.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, these are almost identical, but not quite.
 Given the earlier scatter-plots, the specific rankings of specific pairs
 must be different in each of these.
 How different? The table below lists the top 17 most similar pairs for
 each style of similarity.
 The top number is the similarity score for each style; the negative numbers
 are how much less the next score is, from the top score.

\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset

What can we conclude? Clearly, the naked MI score is exploring all pairings
 of similar things.
 By using the in-group algo, we could expect that all the punctuation gets
 lumped together.
 The HMI seems to fall into a similar trap: the in-group seems to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

their our its your his my
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hard to figure out what to make of this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A tempting conclusion, perhaps a bit 
\emph on
ad hoc
\emph default
, is to use ranked-MI to suggest the initial pair to seed a cluster, but
 then to use either MI, HMI or MMI to expand the actual in-group.
 So, MMI looks pretty slick, but is computationally the heaviest to recompute.
 HMI should be fairly fast, as it's just some logs.
 And MI is computationally 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

free
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, it has to be computed anyway.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where to change this: search code for `optimal-in-group` and specify the
 desired similarity function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hypothesis: it is also possible that these different in-group suggestions
 won't alter very much.
 This is because it is not the initial pair that matters, it is the in-group
 near that initial pair that matters.
 Perhaps all of these end up suggesting similar, or the same in-groups?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Experiment-11 – Deep Merge (also Expt 12 graphs)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the above results, it seems time for a deeper-merge experiment.
 Unlike experiment-10, this one focuses on:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Using plain-MI instead of rank-MI for determining the in-group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Fixes quorum=0.7 and commonality=0.2 and varies the noise: noise= 4,3,2,1
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on expt-10 it looks like quorum=0.7 or 0.8 would give better results.
 Also, it seems like commonality has almost no effect: the chosen grouping
 pretty much always is arrived at with the back-off strategy, rather than
 with commonality exceeding the threshold.
 By contrast, the noise-threshold appears to have a huge effect on what
 gets merged.
 Here's an example.
 For the very first merge, we see
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

------ Round 1 Next in line:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ranked-MI = 9.1671 MI = 9.3888 (`—`, `+`)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

------ Start merge 1 with seed pair `—` and `+` Initial in-group size=8:
 `+` `—` `”` `_` `)` `[` `(` `]` 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

In-group size=8 overlap = 9 of 10975 disjuncts, commonality= 0.08%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

In-group size=7 overlap = 17 of 10530 disjuncts, commonality= 0.16%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

In-group size=6 overlap = 33 of 10107 disjuncts, commonality= 0.33%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

In-group size=5 overlap = 29 of 9433 disjuncts, commonality= 0.31%
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

In-group size=6: `+` `—` `”` `_` `)` `[`
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset

Notable is just how pathetically low the commonality is.
 However, when the merge is actually performed, we see something quite different.
 For noise=4, we get
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

------ merge-majority: Merge 5550 of 7957 sections in 12 secs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

------ merge-majority: Remaining 14284 of 22825 cross in 43 secs  
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset

which tells us that almost all of the merged sections had an observation
 count of less than or equal to 4! That is, 5550+14284 were merged, whereas
 we expected only 6 x 33 x 70% = 140 to get merged! Yowie! This means that
 only 140 sections/cross-sections had an observation count of greater than
 4; the rest of them had a lesser count, and were merged only because they
 were swept up as being under the noise floor.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For noise=3, we see that the number of merged sections drops:
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

------ merge-majority: Merge 4884 of 7957 sections in 11 secs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

------ merge-majority: Remaining 12502 of 22863 cross in 37 secs
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For noise=2, the number of merged sections drops again.
 It's tempting to say that it's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

surprisingly high
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but its not: The Zipfian distribution tells us that there's an incredibly
 fat tail at these low counts.
\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

------ merge-majority: Merge 3586 of 7957 sections in 10 secs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

------ merge-majority: Remaining 9135 of 22963 cross in 35 secs
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset VSpace defskip
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How much harm is there in merging of these low-count tails? My current guess
 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

none
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 These low-count tails contribute very little, or nothing to the word-pair
 MI.
 Right? Or are they nickel-n-diming us to death? (Hmm.
 If they contribute nothing, then they could have been trimmed away from
 the get-go...) Mostly, they hang around, chewing up space...
 Later on, when a dictionary is created, these can be trimmed away, to arrive
 at a more compact dictionary.
 I don't have insight here.
 It's confusing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, due to the preferential-attachment phenomenon that is
 being seen (large clusters getting larger) it might be that these fat tails
 are wagging the dog: they suck in the noise, and then this noise sucks
 in other tails.
 These tails might end up dominating the sense of the cluster? Perhaps we
 should have a noise=0 run to compare against?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, its kind of surprising that the MI can be high but the commonality
 is so low.
 This doesn't make sense intuitively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
What contributes to the MI?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last sentence immediately above seems important enough to get it's own
 subsection.
 What, exactly, is contributing to the MI? We see high MI values, but a
 low Jaccard similarity.
 This seems surprising.
 Is it because the MI's are pairwise, while the Jaccard is for the group
 as a whole?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How does the low-count tail influence the MI? When does trimming tails help?
 When does it hurt? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Progress graphs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Far more graphs from this run.
 All of these graphs are for datasets for which quorum=0.7 and commonality=0.2.
 They differ in the noise setting, varying from 4 to 1.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

older
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dataset is from the previous run, way up above, which had quorum=0.7, commonalit
y=0.4 and noise=4.
 Note that assorted buglets were fixed since that older run.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

precise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 dataset recomputes all word-pair MI for every possible word that was affected
 by the merge.
 This can be hundreds of words, thousands of word-pairs (and is thus slow
 to compute).
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

imprecise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 datasets recompute the MI only for the words directly involved in the merge
 (so, for only a handful of words, and so much faster to compute.) Thus,
 one of the questions is whether the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

precise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 datasets provide materially better classifications, or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Computation of these datasets was terminated with a snowstorm power outage.
 Rather than resuming where these left off, a fresh computation was started,
 with a slightly cleaned up dataset, Experiment 12.
 As can be seen, there are no substantial changes arising from this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shown for comparison are the Experiment-12 graphs.
 These are based on the same underlying dataset as Experiment-11, but are
 cleaned up to remove unconnectable words and disjuncts.
 That is, the dataset is scrubbed to remove all connectors that cannot connect
 to words, and vice-versa.
 This has a minor effect on the graphs, but reduces the amount of annoyance
 and confusion during inspection and debugging.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Experiment-12

 Foo.
 Unable to recover and pick up where they left off; there is some kind of
 bug that prevents restarting (the marginals get unbalanced, and recomputing
 them leaves something wrong...) These halted as shown:

Sparsity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sparsity is defined as always: it is log2 of the fraction of non-zero matrix
 entries to total possible matrix entries.
 Gut instinct says 'slower sparsity growth is better'.
 From the first graph, though, we find a very non-linear growth rate depending
 on the noise threshold.

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Q=-\log_{2}\sum_{d}P\left(*,d\right)P\left(*,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

It varies over time, as both new disjuncts are created, old disjuncts have
 counts drop to zero, and similarly, come words have counts drop to zero
 as they are transferred to the word-classes.

Ranked-MI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next graph shows the ranked-MI of the top-ranked word-pair that triggers
 the merge.
 Were it not for the re-computations of word-pair MI's, this should trend
 downwards, monotonically.
 The re-computation of MI exposes new fragments/remainders of merged classes
 that elevate this MI, briefly, until undisturbed word-pairs are encountered
 again.
\end_layout

Ranked-MI is defined as in 'Diary Part Four', and restated earlier, above.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Marginal Entropies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next four graphs require the frequencies 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left(w,d\right)$
\end_inset

 to be computed.
 This turns out to be error-prone and challenging, and thus will be reported
 here, but turned off in future versions of the code (can be re-enabled
 by setting 
\family sans
(define TRACK-ENTROPY #t)
\family default
 in the code.).
 The problems are these:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The pair-frequencies must be recomputed before starting, and stored.
 This includes the frequencies on CrossSections, which are not normally
 stored.
 After this, the marginal frequencies and the marginal entropies must be
 computed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
As the merges proceed, entropies must be recomputed (they are, if the flag
 is set).
 This adds approx 5 minutes to each merge cycle, which is a significant
 overhead.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The alternative is to create a new matrix API for entropies that always
 computes what is needed on-the-fly, from the counts (which are always correct).
 Doing this is ...
 OK, as it will reduce operational errors, but will add yet more CPU overhead
 to obtaining these stats.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given these issues, it seems that tracking entropies is not worth it.
 I mean, the graphs below are interesting, and all, but they are not Earth-shaki
ng, and don't seem to offer any new insight, beyond some warm fuzzies that
 everything is going fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These remarks apply to some of the class entropies, much further below.
 They won't be available because of the dependency on the 
\family sans
pair-freq-api
\family default
 object.

\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Support of the Class
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The support of a word is the grand-total number of disjuncts assigned to
 that word; likewise for a word-class.
 In formulas, the support is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\Delta\left(w\right)=\sum_{d}\delta\left(w,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta\left(w,d\right)=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{if }N\left(w,d\right)>0\\
0 & \mbox{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

Shown below is 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}\Delta\left(w\right)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

the recently created class.
 Thus, the larger this is, the greater the support.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It might be more edifying to subtract this from the total number of disjuncts:
 this is mildly variable, approximately equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1.05\times10^{6}$
\end_inset

 – that is, a little over a million disjuncts, or about 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}1.05\times10^{6}\approx20$
\end_inset

.
 This would then give the fraction of all possible disjuncts appearing in
 the given word-class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It might be interesting to relate this to the size of the word-class.

\]

\end_inset

The graph below shows 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}P\left(w\right)$
\end_inset

.
 It might be interesting to look at how this correlates with the support.

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
h\left(w\right)=-\sum_{d}P\left(w,d\right)\log_{2}P\left(w,d\right)
\]

\end_inset

The fractional entropy is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
H\left(w\right)=\frac{h\left(w\right)}{P\left(w,*\right)}
\]

\end_inset

This is graphed below.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Compositional Entropy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The compositional entropy is a brand-new concept not discussed earlier in
 this diary.
 It is the entropy of the of the words that went in to form the class.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a class is formed out of the words 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1},w_{2},\cdots,w_{n}$
\end_inset

, the total counts of each of these contributions 
\begin_inset Formula $N\left(w_{1},*\right),N\left(w_{2},*\right),\cdots,N\left(w_{n},*\right)$
\end_inset

 is tracked on the 
\family sans
MemberLink
\family default
 for that class.
 Define the total observation count on this class as 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
N_{C}=\sum_{k}N\left(w_{k},*\right)
\]

\end_inset

This can be used to define a class-relative fraction of how much each word
 contributed to the class:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
P_{C}\left(w_{k},*\right)=\frac{N\left(w_{k},*\right)}{N_{C}}
\]

\end_inset

The compositional entropy is then the ordinary entropy with regards to this
 compositional probability.
 It is defined as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
CH=-\sum_{k}P_{C}\left(w_{k},*\right)\log_{2}P_{C}\left(w_{k},*\right)
\]

\end_inset

It is shown in the graph below.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The compositional entropy is interesting because it gives a hint of how
 different words are contributing to form the class: it's a weighted average
 of the contributions.
 For example, for two words, the compositional entropy is maximized when
 both words contribute equally (and is equal to 1.0).
 Given how the above is scaling, it might be interesting to redo this graph,
 dividing by (the log of) the number of words in the class.

In both cases, the number of word-classes that survived is almost exactly
 half the number of merges run (why half?) This is because classes get repeatedl

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway: One hypothesis: the similarity distributions between word-classes
 should be low.
 That should be quite distinct from one another, one might hope.
 So, three batches of similarity distributions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Similarity between all of the 530 (or 536) word-classes.
 (not counting self-similarity).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Similarity between the top-ranked 530 words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Similarity between the top-ranked words and word-classes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What will it be like? Can we expect the third bullet to show higher similarity
 than the second?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All similarities will be recomputed from scratch, as the existing similarities
 are tainted by the altered disjuncts – i.e.
 the old similarities might not have been recomputed, after a change to
 their disjuncts.
 Only the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

precise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 merges recompute all similarities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Conclusions – Summary
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets summarize what was found below.
 First, the self-similarity distribution for word-classes and other words
 are dramatically different.
 Word-classes have a high self-similarity.
 The shapes of the distributions are different, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distribution of non-zero similarities between classes, and classes and
 words, and just words, are all more-or-less normal distributions (Gaussians),
 all quite similar, all centered on a small negative MI (around -3 to -1.5,
 depending) and fairly narrow (a standard deviation of about 3).
 There are no dramatic differences at this level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a very dramatic difference, when looking at the fraction of all
 possible pairs with zero similarity! Zero similarity corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $-\infty$
\end_inset

 in the MI value; that is, there is zero overlap between the disjuncts.
 They are orthogonal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of all of the possible similarities between the word-classes, only 7% are
 non-zero.
 The classes are highly orthogonal to one-another; only a few of them are
 not.
 By comparison, more than 80% of the words have non-zero similarity between
 one another.
 The words are mostly not orthogonal to one-another.
 In the middle are the similarities between words and classes, coming in
 at just 20% of all pairings.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conclude: the classification algorithms is fairly good at 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

orthogonalizing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Post-classification, the classes are fairly distinct from one-another,
 quite unlike the situation with raw words.
 During classification, it appears that the algo is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sweeping up
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 words in an effective way: The 20% figure seems to say that classification
 really is vacuuming up the words.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above suggests a strong signal for the quality of classification: the
 orthogonal fraction of pairings.
 All three of the above figures should be tracked during classification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Self-similarity Distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The similarity is given by the (symmetric) word-MI.
 The self-similarity is the self-MI.
 Here we go:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics

Above is the distribution of the self-MI for the 530 word-classes and the
 9490 words in 
\family sans
r12-log-q0.7-c0.2-n3.dat.

\family default
 Also, the 536 classes and 9486 words in 
\family sans
r12-log-q0.7-c0.2-n4.dat.

\family default
 Clearly, seems to be quite different.
 What does it mean?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Class–Class Similarity Distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The noise=3 dataset had only 10154 non-vanishing similarities out of a total
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $(530\times531)/2=140715$
\end_inset

 possible pairings of word-classes with one-another (excluding self-similarity).
 For noise=4, there were only 9988 out a possible 536 x 537/2 = 143916 pairings.
 This means that only seven percent (approx.) of the word-classes are similar
 to each other enough to have at least one disjunct in common.
 The rest had zero disjuncts in common! So, word classes are not perfectly
 orthogonal to one-another, but most of them are, considered pair-wise.
 That's a pretty hot result.
 I like it.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gaussian G(-3,3.5) is just an eyeballed fit, as usual.
 The noise=3 curve seems to be shifted slightly to the left.
 One would expect that better clustering shifts these curves leftward.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Word–Word Similarity Distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The noise=3 dataset had 117218 non-vanishing similarities out of a total
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $(530\times531)/2=140715$
\end_inset

 possible pairings of word-classes with one-another (excluding self-similarity).
 For noise=4, there were 117023 out a possible 536 x 537/2 = 143916 pairings.
 So this time, approx 83% of all possible similarity pairs have similarities.
 A very non-orthogonal situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The selected words were the top-ranked ones, out of all possible words.
 The number of words was limited, with the idea that they would be comparable
 in number to the classes.
 
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Gaussian G(-1.5,3.1) is just an eyeballed fit, as usual.
 Note that it is shifted to the right, and is narrower, than the Gaussian
 in the previous figure.
 The noise=3 curve seems to be shifted slightly to the left.
 It is not clear why it should be shifted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compare this to the earlier, pre-merge word-word MI distribution graph,
 about half-way up in this document.
 It's the same distribution, but before any merges have been done.
 This is shown below, relative to the current noise=3 graph.
 Both the mean and the stddev are about the same; maybe a bit of a shift
 of the mean.

The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pre-merge
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 curve is the one from half-way up: it shows similarities for only 200 words,
 and so is noisier.
 The shape of the fat tail is ambiguous.
 Earlier, it looked like a well-defined Gaussian with a very fat tail; but
 here, this is not so clear.
 Clearly, noise=4 suppresses the tail a lot more than noise=3.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Class–Word Similarity Distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The noise=3 dataset had 58555 non-vanishing similarities out of a total
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $530^{2}=280900$
\end_inset

 possible pairings of word-classes with one-another (excluding self-similarity).
 For noise=4, there were 55194 out a possible 
\begin_inset Formula $536^{2}=287296$
\end_inset

 pairings.
 So this is a relatively meek 20% of all possible pairings.
 Conclude that the word-classes have swept up those things that have overlaps.

Hmm.
 Graphed this way, it seems that there are no dramatic differences.
 There are subtle differences, already noted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude: perhaps the most surprising is not the distributions of the
 similarities, but the fraction of the pairs that have non-zero similarity.
 This is the dramatic result we were looking for, even if its not evident
 in these graphs.
