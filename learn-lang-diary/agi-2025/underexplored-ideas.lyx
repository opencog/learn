\begin_layout Abstract
This paper presents a collection of ideas that appear to be commonly neglected
 or underappreciated in AGI systems thinking.
 They deserve a broader understanding and a broader audience.
 Most of these ideas are foundational; forward progress on any of them require
 far more than a few years by small research teams.
 I think they are all exciting.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most or perhaps all the ideas described here are not original, and the careful,
 plugged–in attentive reader is likely to have heard of many of these in
 assorted forums.
 The goal here is to pull them all together into one place, to examine the
 relationships and connections.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the thoughts presented here are both disconnected and yet inter–connecte
d, the introductory overview is best served by an outline:

\begin_layout Section*
Panpsychism or Percolation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many philosophical thinkers first approaching the question of intelligence
 and AGI soon find that the question is difficult enough, and the evidence
 so ambiguous and scattered that panpsychism becomes not just an appealing
 viewpoint, but even seems to get cemented into place with each new piece
 of evidence.
 There are various other ways; the one I wish to draw attention to comes
 from statistical mechanics and the idea of phase transitions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The simplest example has the name 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

percolation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The idea is simple: a fluid can flow through a solid, if the solid has
 enough pores and cavities to connect up and let it through.
 Dip a piece of tissue in water: the water will wick up and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

percolate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 through.
 Hold a sponge under a water tap: the water will fall in, seep through and
 come out the bottom.
 That there is a phase transition is illustrated by fraking in the petroleum
 industry.
 If a rock is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tight
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, old/gas will not flow.
 But if you break it, fracture it, open up cracks, then it will.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That there is a phase transition is seen in the mathematical models of percolati
on.
 Imagine a square grid of points, disconnected.
 Now, randomly sprinkle edges onto that grid: if two points are connected
 by an edge then a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fluid
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can flow between them.
 How many edges have to be randomly sprinkled before two distant points
 are connected? Quite a lot: it turns out to be precisely 0.221...
 (ref Achim Klenke 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

probability
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 book) Before this critical value, there simply is no flow.
 Above it, there is.
 This is a phase transition, and it is a first–order phase transition: it
 is sharp, going from off to on quite suddenly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps the appearance of intelligence in nature works the same way? Below
 a certain threshold, we have dumb rocks and murmuring creeks; above the
 threshold, we have things the respond to stimuli, adapt and move.
 Of course, there won't be just one transition between smart and not–smart.
 A glance at the phase diagram for water shows dozens of phase transitions.
 For carbon, thousands and arguably infinite (diamond, graphite, sheets,
 buckyballs, ribbons...).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is this a useful idea? Perhaps.
 If nothing else, it throws up a roadblock to the idea that even atoms are
 intelligent, and thus cuts off a line of research that seems fruitless.
 Is it difficult? Well, yes.
 We've had many decades of work on scale–free networks and self–organizing
 criticality, but very few of those touched on intelligence until Tononi
 and Tegmark raised the idea to prominence(ref here).
 Fine.
 But we seem to lack a network model, even a simple one, where, on one side,
 we can say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not intelligent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and on the other 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes, at least in this one specially defined way
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This network could be a Markov logic network, a deep–learning neural net;
 don't care.
 Does it demonstrate phase transitions? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Social Media and Topology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Phase transitions typically arise when the network topology changes.
 Before the advent of social media, the human brain–to–brain interconnection
 topology was hub–and–spoke.
 At the center, a single TV station, the hub.
 Around the edges, millions of viewers: the spokes.
 Mainstream media did not talk about flat–earth, because publishers and
 editors were too smart for that: they suppressed rank stupidity.
 Crazy uncle Don's audience was limited to the captive family at Thanksgiving.
 Social media changed how minds are connected to minds: it changed the wiring
 diagram.
 The endless list of current–day craziness issues can be traced back to
 this rapid, sudden change in the network topology.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This has happened before.
 Gutenberg's printing press ushered in the hub–and–spoke model.
 The ability of one author to sway the thoughts of thousands ushered in
 a civilizational boom.
 There was another phase transition before that: about three millennia ago,
 with the invention of the phonetic alphabet.
 Before that, learning to write in hieroglyphics meant being the smart kid
 in the village kidnapped by priests, and being force to learn to read and
 write for the next 10–15 years.
 After that, any shmuck of mildly above–average intelligence could memorize
 a mere 24 symbols, and the sounds associated with them.
 The ability to read and write created an economic boom in the Ancient Mediterra
nean.(ref meaning crisis on youtube) Will the present phase–change in network
 topology be a boon? I hope so.
 But the point here is to realize that 
\emph on
**this is what's going on**

, instead of being perennially mystified by the situation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Agency and Perception
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agency is a hot buzzword as I write this.
 Everybody thinks they know what perception is, and sensori–motor interfaces
 are the dry stuff of robotics textbooks.
 Saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

autopoesis
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a social signal that says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm smart
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 A short review of these concepts is in order.
 The review is relevant because despite the obviousness, **
\emph on

\emph default
** present–day AI system is conceptualized this way; this includes self–driving
 cars and cruise missiles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Agents have an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

inside
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

outside
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The inside is bounded, limited, finite.
 The outside is unbounded: the whole universe.
 In between these two is a sensory system: a way of perceiving the outside,
 and using that perception to update a world model.
 Going the other way, agents have a motor system, allowing them to move.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sight and sound are obvious forms of perception.
 A more basic model is listing a directory in a file system, and moving
 to a different directory.
 Such an agent 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sees
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the file time–stamps, perhaps the file types.
 Maybe even the file contents.
 A smart agent might memorize some of this structure, add it to its world–model.
 Like a web–crawler, it could 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

think
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to itself: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why, I've seen this before, it was over there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and even: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this place looks awfully familiar
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

when was a last here?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Motion here is not motion in a 3D space, but in an abstract, hierarchical
 tree structured universe.
 For a web crawler, its a network graph of directed links.
 Without memory, one can only follow a link.
 With memory, one can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

go anywhere
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but only if one has committed locations (URL's) to the agent's world–model
 of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the world out there
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perception is tied to decision making: the agent decides where to look.
 If the agent is being force–fed data, such as an LLM training run, this
 is not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

perception
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, this is forced updates.
 Agency requires the ability to decide where to go next.
 We are not ready to talk about free will; the decision of what to do next
 could be algorithmically driven.
 Before such discussions can start, there needs to be a locus point at which
 other actions could have been taken, at lest in principle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The update of the agent's world–model requires a bit of perception and action
 itself: asking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

do I have this item in my memory?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a form of perception.
 Placing it in memory, committing it, is a form of action.
 One even has to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

move
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to the right place, to put it there.
 This feels a bit recursive, but eventually it bottoms out: somewhere, there
 is a hard–coded system that actually places bits and bytes somewhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Models of Agency
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's the point of this simplistic talk of agency? Three–fold.
 First, abstraction.
 The above description is so simplistic that perhaps a category–theoretic
 description of it can be created.
 Category theory has a remarkably good fit with software development (ref
 book cat theory for comp sci) Once one has such a description, one can
 reason over it: A theory is itself a network of interrelations that can
 be crawled, expanded, unpacked: in model theory, one has duality between
 collections of axioms and the languages they express (ref book on model
 theory) What is the unpacking of agency?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having an abstract symbolic framework for talking about perception allows
 different forms of perception to be classified according to structure and
 type.
 It allows an agent to attach itself to a sensory organ.
 Given a syntactic description of the sensory device, that description can
 be parsed, the agent knows what kind of data will come in, the agent will
 know how to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

move
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 it's brand–new eyeball and look at things in the world.
 To the agent, its like being given the owners manual to a brand–new microscope,
 written in a language the agent can read.
 It's good to go; no need to wait for a software programmer to stop by and
 surgically attach a youtube video scraper to some diffusion model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Having an abstract symbolic framework for agency provides concrete footing
 for answering the earlier models of phase transitions and intelligence.
 Lets try to create a collection of simple agents, perhaps the simplest
 possible, throw them into a tank, and see what happens: is there a phase
 transition in behavior? Can one side of it be called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dumb
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the other side 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

well, that's interesting!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Is this a new idea? No; the a–life community has been poking at this for
 decades.
 Is the a–life community sufficiently coordinated and coherent to present
 novel discoveries? I don't know.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal here is to arrive at a minimal model, some basic algebraic description
 of pieces–parts that at least plausibly might be assembled into a system
 that one could call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

intelligent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And then explore, at a low level, how such systems might interact, what
 the ecology is, and where the behavioral boundaries are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Self–Awareness
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A precise articulation of awareness should help advance the contentious
 debate about self–awareness and consciousness.
 If one can give a precise syntactic expression to the act of perception,
 and how the act of perception is tied to active updates of the world–model,
 then perhaps this same formalism can be used to have the agent examine
 it's own internals, it's own world model, it's own belief structures.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is not the same as a cruise–missile knowing it's own position or the
 temperature of it's exhaust.
 Those feedback elements are hard–coded, much like adding a centrifugal
 governor to a steam engine does not make it self–aware.
 A part of perception is the choice–point of what to focus on: the attention.
 Naively, one might imagine that self–consciousness is merely self–awareness
 with the freedom to chose what to pay attention to.
 Default mode day–dreaming might be randomly wandering attention.
 Rather than debating with words and opinions, a debate involving formal
 models would be better.
 If those formal models can be used to build networks showing phase transitions
 and self–organized criticality, all the better.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This does not need to be all computer science and mathematics: it is well
 known that ant colonies exhibit a variety of functional states.
 And interesting mode of collapse is when most of the ants decide they want
 to be queen; yes, this happens, but what is the agent–theoretic statistical
 mechanics description of this sudden change in behavior?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ants, one might say, have a very simply psychological profile.
 Would a proper agent–theoretic formulation allow the description of more
 complex psychological states? That is, to examine the question: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what is going on inside the agent's world–model, such that it reacts in
 these ways to these conditions?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what predisposes it to act this way?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Of course, both Pavlov and B.F.
 Skinner looked for mechanistic explanations of psychology.
 Having algebraic formalisms of agency should allow experimental explorations
 of topics that have been heretofore only been raised in the Stanford Encycloped
ia of Philosophy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Hierarchical Control and Time
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nature, as it evolved brains, created a stack of hierarchical control structures.
 The jellyfish neuronal system works: the jellyfish can feed itself, and
 it can flee predators.
 Unfortunately, it is too stupid to stop eating while it's fleeing.
 To fix this problem, nature does not so much replace the network, as to
 add a control layer on top.
 This first shows in the bilaterians (ref good design paper).
 The brain stem is enough to guide invertebrates, but to do better, the
 cerebellum is added on top of the brain stem as a controller.
 That is, the basic architecture is not discarded; it is kept, with a new
 piece introduced to provide finer control.
 This proceeds apace: the cerebrum, cortex, neocortex.
 The spinal cord and cerebellum continue to dominate those functions that
 require millisecond reaction times.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We do not yet see this kind of functional layering in LLM's.
 Presumably this is because no one knows how to do it yet.
 But we may be at a watershed moment: a kind of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

microscope
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for observing LLM internals has been described (ref Haiku anthropic paper).
 That neuroscope has outputs that seem to be symbolic, corresponding to
 what GOFAI would call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

concepts
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Is there enough there, to be able to attach the observed items to classical
 symbolic AI systems? Is this perhaps an avenue for rational control? This
 is a hot take as this letter is being written; it may be old news by the
 time it is published.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Time Scales and Shocks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A characteristic of control systems is that they work at different time
 scales.
 One reason that nicotine addiction is hard to quit is because there are
 five distinct control systems, tied in feedback loops, each reinforcing
 the last.
 The fastest ones are purely chemical, involving just neurotransmitters
 and their re–uptake mechanisms.
 These operate at the ten–minute timescale and drive craving at that scale.
 Higher layers tie into neuronal circuits: even if you've resisted a cigarette
 for hours, these circuits pump the neurons to keep the craving alive.
 Deeper circuits operate at the multi–day, multi–week and multi–month time–frame
s.
 Even if you've successfully busted the lowest, fastest layers, a well–placed
 magazine advertisement can reignite the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multi–timescale systems provide stability and control against excursions.
 They are widespread in biological nature, and also in economic & political
 systems: corporate plankton go to work every day, but meetings are weekly,
 and corporate reviews are quarterly.
 Each corrects for excursions in the last.
 The system is hierarchical not just in organizational structure, but also
 in time–scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Multi–timescale systems are also prone to disregulation by shocks.
 The prototypical one is the economic shock: a disruption of supply cannot
 be instantly counter–acted by increased production.
 The system, knocked out of balance, usually functions poorly until balance
 is regained.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Temes and super–human AGI
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is sometimes said that corporations are a weak form of super–human AGI:
 they never sleep, they operate 24x7, are far more powerful than most humans
 (the oligarchs are exceptional) and can have lifetimes in excess of a hundred
 years.
 There is a notion of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

teme
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

technological meme
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, of which nicotine forms the prototypical example.
 Nicotine is not just a neurotransmitter; it is also a multi–billion dollar
 industry built to manufacture and deliver nicotine to those who want it.
 As an industry, it has existed for more than 400 years.
 It can be and should be thought of as a super–human feedback loop, operating
 at the dendritic, synaptic level at its lowest reaches, and as a complex
 network of banking and commerce at the highest level.
 In a certain sense, one could say that it does not care about humans: the
 profit motive long overwhelmed concerns about lung cancer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some super–human functional structures are wildly harmful to humans: World
 War One was an industrial killing machine that shut down only when the
 supply of raw materials ran out: there were no more young men left to kill.
 Despite the best efforts of politicians and generals, no one could seem
 to find the off–switch, even as the machine hummed along in a collection
 of feedback loops that guaranteed a continuous supply of young men and
 bullets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The point of this story is that it is often imagined that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true AGI
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will somehow magically decide to be beneficial and friendly.
 There is foundation for this belief is due to a misperception of mammalian
 traits.
 Babies love their mothers, not just in humans, but in all mammals.
 Birds, too.
 This is innate, biological, presumably an artifact of evolution.
 There's more: the famous Capuchin monkey cucumber–grape experiment (ref
 youtube) shows that the sense of justice and fairness is not a uniquely
 human trait.
 Silicon intelligences do not have this wired in, as a fail–safe fallback
 mechanism.
 You won't find a youtube video of a cute fuzzy furball of an LLM bouncing
 around.
 There's nothing identifiable as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

love
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 engineered into transformers.
 there are texts that speak of love in the training set, but these texts
 do not have some exalted status or primordial priority.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Social media and algorithms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other point of this story is that all work on LLMs, AI and AGI is being
 integrated into the fabric of brain–to–brain communications as quickly
 as that technology becomes stable and usable.
 I was in attendance at one AGI conference near the start of the Putin's
 attack on Ukraine.
 I kept saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Ukraine
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 throughout the conference, with those words falling on deaf ears.
 If Putin could get his hands on advanced AI, of course he would use it
 as a weapon against the Ukrainians.
 Whatever safety and control modules were in there, it does not seem like
 it would be a stretch to subvert and jail–break them in order to kill Ukrainian
s.
 There is already a eugenics experiment underway: the Silovoki: the intentional
 inter–breeding of police officers, military officers and FSB (ex-KGB/Checka)
 operatives it is about three or four generations in.
 We breed dogs and horses for traits, and it does not take that many generations
, either.
 There's no reason to think it doesn't work in humans.
 Some fraction of that mammalian love and cute–furball fuzziness is being
 bred out with each generation.
 Add access to sophisticated AI to such a social network, and you have a
 recipe for disaster.
 Our work on AGI does not take place on Block Island, behind three layers
 of security.
 Its perhaps a bit more like Wuhan.
 If this sound political, that is because it is: AGI won't be integrated
 into the net as some kind of better search engine.
 It will be integrated at the political level, and will exhibit all the
 features that we already worry about in the algorithmic control of social
 media.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far, these topics are discussed by a relatively small group of social
 scientists.
 The technology blogeratti appear to be blissfully unaware of the issue,
 much as AGI conference attendees from prior years seems unaware and uncaring
 of the rather direct interconnections between the War in Ukraine and the
 social media algorithms.
 AGI super–intelligence will be integrated into the fabric of humanity much
 like how nicotine is integrated in.
 And it won't have mammalian love instincts unless we figure out how that
 actually works.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Could an algebraic formalization of agency and the ecology (statistical
 mechanics) of such systems provide enlightenment into the mechanism of
 love? Sounds like a far–fetched day–dream, but its perhaps more realistic
 than thinking that a bunch of prompts will solve the problem.
 Or worse: simply taking it as an article of faith that AGI will be benevolent.
 Large superhuman ecosystems: jungles and forests are not benevolent.
 I doubt AGI would be some exception.
 Even supposedly benevolent systems, such as the Catholic Church, have been
 found to have some nasty failings.
