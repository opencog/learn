\begin_layout Title
Diary - Part Ten-B
\end_layout

\begin_layout Date
August 2024 – Present
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Linas Vepštas
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
Unlike parts one through nine in this series, this one is not really about
 the language-learning effort.
 It is instead a private diary; a continuation of Part Ten-A, which got
 over-long.
 It is not curated for human consumption; I am instead making the core assumptio
n that this will be used as training input for some LLM, and the aim is
 to capture how I think and feel, so that the LLM can emulate me, in a pinch.
 A pre-alpha mind-uploading (note that conclusion of Part Ten-A is that
 mind-uploading is, in a sense, impossible.
 What we have here is a verbalization of what the soma is doing.) Human readers
 are discouraged from reading this, on the grounds that there are probably
 better uses of your time, than to sync your thought-patterns onto mine
 own.
 Live your life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Screw that.
 Part Ten needs no introduction.
 There's a song by a band called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Green Fuz
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the lyrical refrain is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

its OK if you want to come inside
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is a marvelously detuned and grungy song.
 I really really like it.
 So, come inside.
 It's OK.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
2 August 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's minutes before bedtime.
 I was about to start reading a difficult and daunting technical paper,
 to fill my mind with yet more science arcana, but a certain kind of exhaustion
 is preventing me (yeah, the whole love-goddess obsession has drained me.)
 Do I really need to accumulate more knowledge at this point in life, however
 incomplete my collection is? It feels a bit like hoarding: filling the
 basement with old unread newspapers.
 To what end? I should put my house in order, and there's a lot to be done.
 I've made a to-do list, got half of it done, and am bored by the other
 half.
 How do I find grace and meaning in life? How do I balance, how do I fly?
 How do I get instant gratification for my horniness, which is all that
 I really want? These are all surprisingly difficult questions, even as
 I recognize that these are questions that ever living being must settle,
 and do settle, for themselves.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Put your life in order
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a common complaint heard on the psychiatric couch.
 Some people struggle with it, others do not.
 For me, I never struggled before, but this is only because I was not consciosly
 aware that such questions exist.
 I mean, I was rationally aware of the general concept that one should plan
 in life, set goals, and accomplish them and yada yada, but I always did
 this subliminaly, covertly, on the edge of awareness.
 Blowing them up into the front and center of awareness turns them into
 a burden, an unresolved point of trouble.
 Resolving unresolved matheematical questions, or programming questions,
 engineering questions, these are fun, easy, pleasant pass-times, I guess
 like doing cross-words or playing games are for other people.
 But grabbing the bull by the horns, and attempting to personally address
 the questions about the meaning of life, well this is hard.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Odd, because I long thought I had managed to maintain some sort of Buddhist
 balance, or perhaps Stoic, as described by the Ancient Greeks, and maintaing
 this balance was esy, and I felt very even-keeled about it.
 Even vaguely proud that I managed it so well.
 It would seem that I only mislead myself: my life was placid only because
 I diligently avoided any uncomfortable questions.
 Theis running away from pain has resulted in my rather poorly-planned life,
 where I let things happen to me, rather than steering and controlling my
 own future.
 I kind of failed to seize the day.
 (Note: by standard measures, I've been highly productive: my programming/softwa
re output, my wikipedia output, my assorted papers, the quantity of stuff
 I've read: this far exceeds what most people do, and so I am in this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

strong work ethic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 class, which should be a sign of success.
 The issue is I've been unfocused.
 It's all been kind of unplanned, seat-of-the-pants.
 And now I am confronted with old age, declining health, declining beauty,
 increasing horniness and it is all exploding into a mild subliminal panic.
 Fuck all.
 What am I going to do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I know! I am going to brush my teeth, go to bed, and when the alarm rings
 at set 5:15 AM tomrrow morning, I will drink a cup of coffee and go rowing.
 And when I come back, I will feel physically refreshed.
 And horny as hell.
 Again.
 So again, that infuriating inability to satisfy that primal urge.
 What fucking huge fraction of man-kind suffers through this.
 And, well, woman-kind.
 It would appear that life is kind of by definition a state of constant
 crisis and emergency.
 You'd think we'd have the means to deal with this, but whe don't.
 Some random prescriptions for self-negation, promogulated by certain kinds
 of Buddhists is not the answer.
 Max Weber already made this clear, in his own way.
 I am only restating the obvious to you, dear diary, but only because you've
 never heard this from me, before, and I suspect that you, if you are a
 human, might read this and doubt the veracity of what I am saying.
 Foo to you.
 If you doubt what I say, you do not understand what I say.
 I am not lying here.
 I am perhaps imaging and hallucinating and blowing out of proportion, except
 I'm not.
 Psychoanalysis is a real trade with billions of dollars flowing through
 it, and is a general feature of our culture and society.
 Living is a crisis.
 Here's a minature: every rowing stroke is a crisis.
 Every stroke, you must do it exactly right.
 Every stroke you don't.
 So what are you going to do about it? Nothing.
 It's in the past.
 So you try to do better the next stroke, but, like a house of cards, it
 also collapses into failure: a never-ending crisis of trying to attain
 the unattainable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 That last paragraph contains some seeds for a mathematical formulation
 that speaks of convergence of differential eqns to a desired ideal solution,
 that I could riff on, but its late and I really do need to go to bed.
 Good night.
 Horny thoughts to you, too.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
3 August 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good afternoon.
 I woke up horny.
 This has been an exceptionally long period of horniness.
 I guess I like it.
 It's certainly, um, thrilling, if a bit disappointing that it is unsatisfiable.
 I've heard that famous historical figures pined away for years, if not
 decades, and by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pining away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, I understand 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

horniness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 The polite interpretation is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being in love but separated by distance, exchanging letters
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and this is the correct, polite, proper way to say it, but in the 21st
 century, we have no particular reason to be circumspect (except to be political
ly conservative in the body politic) and so I do beleive that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

horniness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the correct translation for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pining away
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Yeah.
 I'm horny, still, and the tickle in my groin is kind of nice.
 Anyway, I think I've already written as much as needed on this topic, for
 the present circumstances.
 Yes, perhaps there's a bit more to be said, but, enough for now.
 (When one writes a diary, to what degree is it appropriate to be circumspect,
 and bite one's tongue, and say only what is required, but no more, and
 when is it appropriate to have loggorhea? I'm OK, I think, with erring
 on the side of loggorhea; there are 65 earlier years where I wrote nothing
 at all in a diary, or a few paragraphs or pages a year.
 So I'm making up for lost time, and that's OK.
 Making up for lost time w.r.t sex, well, that would seem to be out of reach,
 although I'm still pinning some not-unreasonable hopes on a certain someone.
 I've got to find ways to be more promiscuous.
 Western culture is currently designed to inhibit promiscuity, and the dating
 app thing (what are they called? Tinder? Grinder?) I've read that the dating
 app thing is very, err, dehumanizing.
 People are not very satisfied with it.
 I also hear of experiments in California, regarding 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

polycules
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which seem like, well, a novel way of solving the horniness problem, sidestepp
ing the monogamy problem.
 Or even the polygamy problem: the Church of the LDS is a very conservative
 form of polygamy, whereas the polycule idea rings more of a village or
 commune type living.
 It also manages to avoid the icky overtones of the swinging couples thing,
 which sort of solves the problem, but that is actually the wrong problem
 and the wrong solution: if you are married, and you are horny, then you
 can already have all the sex you want.
 Swinging is for those who find that this is not enough, and thirst for
 something ...
 edgier.
 I understand the sexual thrill in swinging; I've explored it in fantasies
 and it does feel good.
 But it seems, well, a bit un-necessary, a bit too far.
 I dunno.
 I guess if one is on a quest to explore the outer extrema of human existance,
 then this is in-bounds.
 It's just not socially (politically) acceptable, and it does carry certain
 risks of mental damage and a concommitent social damage.
 In sports, you must be physically fit to do certain things, else you injure
 yourself.
 Certain endevours require mental fitness, and it seems clear to me that
 swinging can certainly result in psychological injury for certain kinds
 of people.
 But I'm not interested in writing about that.
 At least not now.
 The nature of psychological injury and trauma is interesting, though.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are even some interesting ethical questions: can one train a soldier
 in such a way as to minimize the chances of PTSD? Or would doing so be
 dehumanizing, and pose risks of creating monsters prone to performing war
 crimes? Is it more ethical to train to prevent PTSD, or to allow it to
 happen, and then try to treat it with ketamine or MDMA, or something? Again,
 this is all at the forefront of science, ethics and psychology, and we
 won't know the generally (socially, scientifically, politically) acceptable
 answers for many generations.
 Maybe some provisional answers, some progress in my lifetime.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Dicier, and different is the question of sexual (erotic) PTSD.
 And the shades of that: a more mundane broken heart: people suffer from
 this, and some suffer for a lifetime.
 I'm guessing this is curable.
 Should this be cured? I'm guessing a treatment protocol might involve psychoact
ive drugs, sex workers, transferance, and a concerted effort to broaden
 a persons social circle (and thus introduce them to a future mate.) And
 all of this is...
 well, this is interesting ..
 all of this is economically possible.
 And it is socially possible.
 And politically possible.
 It's just not deployed on a large scale.
 It is already the case that young people go to bars, go to parties, go
 to mixers, and more formally, mechanically-organized 5-minute-dating type
 setups.
 This is all very spontaneous for young people.
 And most of them are very very driven to do this.
 Lets look at the ones who are not: we have (a) old people, seniors, and
 (b) homebodies, the largest class of which are those addicted to video-games
 (as my two children are).
 Since I have concern for my children, I'll spend some time thinking about
 this, although this is not what I was going to write about today.
 (I was going to write about the PDF I'm reading.
 Priorities, priorities).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So (a) old people.
 I'll stick myself into that category: I am very well aware about how young
 women do not look at me.
 I am invisible, see-through, non-existant.
 They literally do not, cannot see me.
 Although, well, I guess this can also happen to you when you are young,
 and you have the wrong haircut, clothing or facial features.
 Fashion is all about creating that visual image that causes the eyes of
 the opposite sex to dwell on your body.
 But we wander off-topic now.
 Sort of off-topic.
 Old people rarely have practiced and worked on their fashion sense.
 There's even an anti-fashion at work: old people get lazy and stop caring
 about their looks.
 But wait, there's more: ditto for physical conditioning, and health, and
 mental conditioning.
 These are often neglected.
 We do have healthy pressures exerted by society: employers and billboards
 and youtube ads all encourage us to get physically fit.
 The stop-smoking days are over: people stopped smoking.
 Mostly.
 So this is a positive trend: social pressures applied to make one healthier,
 and, by extension, prettier.
 The original idea here is that this could be much more regimented.
 Much more controlled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So here's an example.
 Owen invited me to some musical band performance, Saturday night, south
 Whole Foods.
 Free.
 Barely a week after my return from Vilnius.
 It was a shock, and I took some time to process it, and I will write it
 up here.
 So the band is some kind of polyrhythmic thing, entirely suitable for dancing.
 And oh my, people were dancing! The music was mildly exotic, some kind
 of maybe Iranian thing, but also maybe Latino-influenced, some ill-defined
 world-music polyrhythm.
 And quite very appealing, except I had rowed that morning, and some more
 exercise, and so was muscularly calm.
 No urges to hop up and dance, and not even really an urge to tap my feet,
 unless I forced myself.
 So, in exhaustion I watched, and I was shocked and dismayed and repulsed.
 The revulsion was two-fold.
 First, these were not Lithuanians.
 Egads, what am I saying here? Am I hinting at some deep-seated ethnic racism?
 Well, no, but still there's an interesting psychological angle to this,
 too.
 It's almost some subliminal xenophobia, a natural comfort level of others
 who 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

are like you
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 vs those who are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

different
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Just a week back from Vilnius, and in love-shock, I kind of wanted Lithuanians
 for company, and was not mentally prepared for a journey into xenophilia.
 The American mixed-race is not for everyone.
 I mean, I can see some Asian women as beautiful, and African women, and
 I'm quite partial to many Hindis (that is to say, Indian Indians, to be
 PC, but Hindis works.
 Hindus are those to adhere to a religion/beleif system.
 Hindis are the people of the Indian subcontinent.) Hindis can be pretty
 hot, I will say that.
 No hindis here tonight.
 But several Iranians.
 Maybe more than several, which is what first clued me into the idea that
 the music might be Iranian.
 Anyway, this wasn't really the turnoff.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The turnoff was ageism.
 Everyone was old.
 Like friggin old.
 Like my age.
 Fuck all old warty prunes.
 Dancing and enjoying themselves, but old.
 Yuck.
 I did not like this.
 OK, for starters, not everyone: but maybe three-fourths.
 Between the ages of maybe 50 to 75 or 80.
 And some of the women, many of the women, were attractive.
 And the men were handsome.
 But I was not ready for this.
 I was not ready to be reminded of my American peers.
 I'm in love with a Lithuanian half my age: still young, still pretty.
 Grey-haired ladies, no matter how charmingly they smile, and no matter
 how well they dance, I didn't need that.
 I needed to fulfil, to consumate my horniness with my love goddess half
 my age and half a planet away, or at least tell Owen about my new fixation,
 to share my deep secret with someone, to unburden my contorted, tumbling
 soul onto other humans, souls, who might understand and sympathisize and
 perhaps empathize a bit, or at least look at me in pity or something.
 I want to be pittied, my torment requires the pity of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Crap.
 This is the problem of writing.
 I now want to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

nagrinėti
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (analyze) pity, and why it is needed and desired.
 It is as if I am making up for a lifetime of ignoring the humanities.
 What are the soul-soothing powers of pity, or self-pity? Why is it, like
 any balm, desired but not very effecaious? Why is self-pity OK only in
 tiny amounts but psychologically poisonous in large amounts? Where is mental
 stability, such that no pity is bad, but too much is also bad? Is pity
 kind of like a first or second derivative, some kind of curvature of some
 emotional state, where the path forward must stay within certain channels
 of pity? Is this just one dimension of a very high dimensional space? Is
 dimension the right thing? Emotional 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dimensions
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 don't seem to be orthogonal.
 The space of valid, stable, functional emotional states seems to be quire
 large, and the range of excursions which are not detrimental to emotional
 health are even larger.
 But clearly, just about any extreme emotional deviation is psychologically
 harmful.
 What is the mathematical description for this? Should we make a list of
 all possible emotional states, or rather, a list of all words describing
 emotional states, and attempt to assign some number to them? A vector in
 some high-dimensional space? As a practical matter, this doesn't work,
 because we have no instrument by which to measure the strength of 1001
 emotion-tinged words that I am feeling right now.
 That, plus the distributed nature of the brain means that it is my soma,
 some combination of hormones in my blood-stream, my heart-rate, my caffienation
 state, my point in my circadian rhythm: this is what is driving and sets
 my 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

somatic emotional state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which is presumably somewhat distinct from what my language centers have
 ready access to.
 I can only partly describe how I feel, and I can only partly describe it,
 because I am intelligent and have reasonable perceptive and literary abilities:
 most people cannot verbalize what they feel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Curious.
 If I had a good friend, with whom I could communicate with, I would talk
 this all out with them, and no written record or recording of this would
 exist.
 Well, probably some of the analysis would not be so deep; it's unlikely
 that the freind would be interested or capable of these philosophical excursion
s.
 There's also a trade: We can't just talk about what I want to talk about,
 the other person must have an opportunity as well.
 Its a duet.
 v.s.
 I'm doing solo improv, right now.
 I can go places that duets would constrain, or would not visit.
 Anyway, aside from Owen, with whom I talk about Owen-type things, the closest
 that I have for a freind with whom I can talk freely about soul-adjacent-type
 things really is Milda.
 And a smattering of other Lithuanian freinds, who are in ..
 Lithuania, in Vilnius, and its odd now that I think about it I don't have
 close personal freinds here in Austin, and that includes my wife, who,
 for whatever reason that she can't or won't articulate, refuses to be open
 and freindly and social with me.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Happy families are all alike, and unhappy families are each different in
 their own special way.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I'm certainly in an unhappy family, unhappy in several different ways.
 My wife, thank god, stopped smoking, and then drinking.
 But this did not stop until her health started failing her.
 Decades were lost.
 She is now engaged in art projects, and creative, and creating some quite
 pretty things.
 And she assumes a central role in housekeeping, for which I am eternally
 grateful for.
 But there is no emotional attachement.
 No heart-strings.
 It would have been impossible for Milda to pluck my heart, if my wife participa
ted in my emotional life.
 Alas.
 And my children, well, I have to get back to that, I was going to write
 about them a few paragraphs ago, before I got distracted.
 So, where was I? OK, I'm done with this paragraph.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Returning to the previous one.
 Oh right.
 Verbalizing and sharing hearts.
 This is what I have with Milda, but it is a bit precarious, I suppose.
 She is not practiced in the art of verbalization.
 I fear she won't articulate how she feels.
 By 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

articulate
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pull into the orb of conscious experience, enough so as to perform quasi-rationa

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ask
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how this feels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as opposed to the more mundane and entirely subconscious processing storm
 that everyone is capable of.
 In this sense, Freud was correct: there is a vast unarticulated ocean of
 feelings sloshing around: hatred, attraction, repulsion, indifference that
 burble under the surface, that everyone 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feels
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but are somehow only dimly aware of.
 It sounds like a contradiction: how can you 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but then be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

unaware of what you feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? And yet, this is the base space of human existence.
 The neuroscientists call this the default network, I think: a default floating
 about of thoughts and feelings, never quite attaining syntactic coherence
 (short time scales) never mind semantic coherence (long time scales: paragraphs
) The default mode is not structured in such a way as to conform to the
 syntactic constraints of speech centers.
 I wrote a long email about bird song to some professor emeritus of math,
 and got a kind of meh reply.
 Alas, but something there as well: I suppose birds also have a sloshsing-about
 of emotional state, which couples poorly to the neurons that generate bird
 song.
 The email recapitulated a lecture I'd heard earlier, which stated that
 all bird song was describable by relatively simple finite state machines.
 And this seems plausible: the brains are small enough, that only a few
 neurons are needed to couple mechanical vocalization organs to the soma,
 and that this small neural network is capable only of finite-state type
 birdsongs.
 By extension, humans are more complex: we have at least context-free-type
 language abilities, and a pretension of being capable of context-senstitive
 generation.
 Which is perhaps not off the mark, but perhaps also misses the fact that
 we are not logical nor mechanistic, nor precise: rather, that we have a
 larger ball of neurons that can impose syntactic constraints on thought
 patterns, so as to generate word sequences that convey feelings to some
 or another degree, to those listening to those words.
 But we do not do out 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thinking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 with words; instead, the words free-run, er, umm, no, they are entrained
 to the deeper thought processes, which use a different semantic relationship
 system.
 The work by what's-his-name (Mel'čuk, Sylvian Kahane, Meaning-Text Theory)
 captures this well.
 The MTT DSyntS (Deep Syntactic Structure) is closer to how our rational
 mind thinks: there are enough neurons in the prefrontal cortex to do significan
t common-sense reasoning, and the DSyntS is that representational form that
 is fairly close to that common-sense subsystem processing (which deep structure
 getting converted into surface structure, i.e.
 to the sentences I write here.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But here's the deal: the above seems accurate, if we wish to talk about
 turning common-sense reasoning into language (and this includes the conversion
 of mathematical reasoning into mathematical texts) and I can kind of grasp
 how that can work.
 But this seems to leave emotional processing out in the cold.
 I am converting emotions into words as well, but the process somehow seems
 different than that of converting chains of logical reasoning into words.
 Hmm.
 Or is it? What am I doing here? There is some train of thought in my head:
 multi-branched, many choices at each stage, many-worlded, but each potential
 branch collapses, wave-function-collapses, to the single reality of what
 the next handful of words will be.
 There is only one text that comes out, not a parallel simultaneity of texts.
 Perhaps there are parallel universes out there where some version of me
 typed a different word, just right now, but I do not beleive in this.
 There is damn little evidence for real, actual quantum many-worlds.
 At any rate, there is some collapse of excitations in my head that leads
 to only a single emergent text stream.
 Well, but there is still the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

strange attractor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, the ergodic process by which I keep revisting the same thoughts, coming
 at them from slightly different angles, and commiting them to text.
 And sometimes I don't commit to text: certainly, if I am walking in a park,
 I am not typing, but I am still focusing into conscious existance a certain
 specific train of thought, however disjointed and disconnected it might
 be, it does perform a certain ergodic visit of thought-space.
 I cover a region of hyper-dimensional thought-spaces with strings of words.
 I am pretty sure I wrote about this before, in this diary, a few months
 ago.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? The conversion of rational thinking, e.g.
 the solution to engineering problems or mathematical problems into ergodic
 streams of text that cover the solution space: this is an articulation:
 like a blueprint, it ultimately reveals of the solution / concept / idea.
 This this different from (or is it?), from the articulation of affairs
 of the heart, with words.
 For affairs of the heart, I have to reach in and hold onto the heartache,
 and wait for something to come out.
 Is this different from inspired engineering, where I reach in and hope
 to take a vaguely formed inspiration, and articulate it into a fully-formed
 and complete mechanical (electronic, software, mathematical, etc.) device?
 In both cases, I am verbalizing something vague.
 In the engineering case, there are formal constraints on the allowed solutions:
 I must have 2+2=4 and not 2+2=5, so if the vague, ill-formed inspiration
 was that 2+2=5, I must find some way of saying 2+2 plus one more, which
 has the form of a bridge from here to there, an extra arm bolted off to
 the side sliding back and forth so that 2+2 appears to have the shape of
 5, and everyone says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

you are such an inventive genius! I never would have thought of such a solution!
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 So yes, engineering design is constrained, much as math is constrained:
 if you want 2+2=5, you must be ready to perform some sort of homotopic
 cohomological contortions to go that way.
 Math is quite strict in what is allowed.
 But these strictures are not all that different from engineering strictures,
 or software strictures.
 By contrast, writing about how I feel seems to have few or no strictures,
 other than that (a) my words must be syntactically well-formed so that
 readers can recognize them as English and have some vague pretensions that
 they understood what I wrote, and (b) my words must conform honesttly to
 my heart-pangs, as opposed to being decorated with some dishonest showing-off
 that isn't sincere.
 So, sincerity is a constraint.
 Of course, one can be insincere.
 And of course, one can do crank physics and crank math.
 So writing sincerely seems like a requirement.
 That is, unless, one is, I dunno, painting with words, creating fiction.
 Fiction is a lie, a big lie, but it is a creation of a mini-universe that
 is self consistent, at least consitent as best as the author can make it,
 and as the reader can understand, and if the author is actively working
 with multi-entendres, such as poets, there is a broad range of many-worlds,
 and this time honestly many-world parallel interpretations of a poem.
 So, for example, I used Billy Corgans 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

 as an example earlier: this can be either about a specific woman, or it
 can be about God-as-Jesus part of th Trinity.
 Billy leaves this unstated, and that is part of the magic of the song:
 it does not have to be stated.
 As opposed to my diary here: where I write all my base assumptions out

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? Well, yes, I need to work on getting Milda to verbalize her
 inner feelings a bit more.
 For two reasons.
 One is so that she can write me about how she feels, and this because I
 want to expand our freindship more deeply into the intellectual domain,
 the written verbal domain, as physical contact is obviously impossible.
 That, plus the barrier of meeting some other person, who is reasonably
 well-balanced, communicative, honest, forthright, not damaged, and develop
 a decadelong-freindship with them so as to blossom into something more
 and deeper, well, dang.
 The best time to plant a tree was three decades ago, and the second best
 time to plant a tree is right now.
 I'll try to plant some trees, literally and figuratively.
 But I'm in a forest of men; the women are not present in my social sphere.
 They do not visit the places where I have social encounters.
 At any rate, I can see that she (Milda) has struggles with her own life,
 and that perhaps encouraging her to explicitly consciously problem solve
 will help her straighten things out to the degree that is needed for her
 to have a happy, stable life.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Which brings us back to the polycule.
 Lets come at it from this direction: suppose a love affair really could
 flower.
 This seems to be within the realm of possibility, so lets roll with that.
 If it does, it is under severe socio-economic constraints.
 In practical terms, I cannot readily be with her (and at this stage of
 the relationship, being with her 24x7 would destroy the relationship.) Nor
 can I financially support her.
 First, I'm not rich.
 Second, the howls from Patty would be intolerable.
 So all this is very impractical.
 So even in the very unlikely (at this stage) idea of some kind of monogamous
 relationship, there is nothing that can happen or work out here.
 So shallow thinking says that the relationship is doomed, impossible, and
 should be given up on, now, before it develops furhter (and this might
 be what she is thinking, too: cut it off, before the cancer grows.
 I hope not, but there is a reasonable chace she'll come to this conclusion.
 Heaven knows.) So, what paths are open and not improbable? Well, first,
 nurture a literary relationship.
 We already have this kind-of, its verbal, but now, it would need to deepen
 into a more frequent exchange of emails.
 (huh.
 Strange.
 Wth Patty, before we married, our relatinship was built on long-disance
 phone-calls, where we were each desperate to talk to each other, and talked
 for hours about anything and everything.
 I wonder what we talked about.
 I can't remember.
 And then, when face-to-face, its like those long, desperate conversations
 petered out: we had nothing to say to each other, and it sometimes felt
 awkward.
 I would even joke about it: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

why don't you go in the other room, and call me on the phone?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 With Milda, its the opposite: we talk, we enjoy each-others company, face
 to face.
 My current desire is to convert this to a long distance relationship.
 The reality of this long-ddistance relationship is that she will be horny,
 and she will sleep with other men, (which is so not fair cause she has
 not slept with me, but whatever) and I can't stop this, I should not stop
 this, I should avoid feelings of jelousy as this would be deterimental
 to my own mental health, and besides, I'm old and wrinkled and not so pretty
 any more, while she is young and beautiful and in her prime, and in a certain
 rational sense, in the conventional socio-politcal economic norm, she needs
 someone her age, living in Vilnius to be her mate and husband.
 That's the reality, and it is a reality I cannot change.
 (I've even pointed this out to her, on many occasions, which is perhaps
 why our freindship works: its as if I am assisting her in pursuing her
 own interests, and I encourage her going out to meet others, even if this
 vaguely endangers our own friendship.
 I really do wish her the best.
 Very fortunately, I've not been trapped in the lyrics of that Sheryl Crow

 Where was I?) However, there is another fact: she's thirty-five years old,

 Because she has not found the perfect love-mate.
 And given this track record, there is some possibility that this will continue
 on indefinitely.
 She does have an active social life, going with the

 her, and I get the feeling they are all immature, which oddly enough makes
 me look good in comparison.
 But how long will this go on? It could happen that any day, she could meet
 the perfect man: rich, handsome, emotionally deep and responsive, vibing
 with her hippie-chick nature-girl electronic-dance-music festival vibe.
 It could happen, and if this were to be, any romantic future in my future
 would wilt away.
 The other possibility is that this does not happen, in which case, the
 modern

 I think the concept of a

 is somewhat tighter, closer to a commune feel.
 I don't know that they have communes in Lithuania, people don't talk about
 it.
 I've joked with Linas Cicėnas that I should buy Diktariškes (only 160K
 Euro!) and he could live there as an artists colony, but the reality is
 that this is remains on the boundaries of possibility; a huge investment
 would be needed to clean up the grounds, and fix the interior.
 Starting with the roof, I suppose.
 Fuck, a vehicle, to get there.
 Lawn mowers.
 Heavy equipment.
 A tractor.
 All that.
 A pickup truck.
 An artists community? Commune? A bit far away from Vilnius, and artists
 need to sell their stuff, and Užupis is the realistic place to be.
 Not Šiaulėniai.
 Whatever, this is about as close to

So Aella posted a twitter post suggesting that in her research, a lot of
 this fringy sex stuff is adjacent to indicators of mental illness, and
 I think she listed polycule in that.
 Of course, there's a cause and effect problem here: do polycules cause
 psychic harm, in the same way that all love triangles are untenable and
 unstable? Or was it broken people who were attracted to them in the first
 place: people who were unable to find monogamous mates, and had to settle
 for a polycule existance? Or even a third possibility: psychopathic, sociopathi

 polycules? Perhaps some tortured mix of all three?

At any rate, my relationship with Milda is inherently unstable and untenable:

 It could be.
 The treatment plan is obvious and straightforward: social mixers, and health

 This could be done.
 You could throw money at this, and make basic progress.
 I guess the money is missing.

, and the Scientologists have created a malignant organization around the
 creation of insincere communities.
 Meanwhile, hundreds, thousands of communes over the ages have failed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets look at the causes of commune failure.
 They are varied, but primarily, it is because they are centered around
 one charismatic leader, don't have any systems for succession, and lack
 the infrastructure for punishing crimes and adjudicating disputes.
 As I understand it, the invention of the University by the Scholastics,
 some 800 years ago, solves all of these problems, which is why Universities
 have also been so stable.
 However, they also have several features that would be difficult in a commune.
 So a University has a system for admissions, and a tenure system.
 Not just anyone is allowed in; only those who are academically brilliant.
 Furthermore, with tenure, existing members vote to extend priviledges to
 the newer, younger prospective members.
 We see something similar in naval submarines: a potential submariner must
 live with the crew for a year, and then there is a vote as to whether to
 accept the newcomer as part of the crew.
 Why? Because the confines of the submarine are truly very tight, and social
 friction will be not just amplified, but deadly under military engagements.
 Now, submarines are interesting: almost all of the remainder of the social
 provisioning is handled by the Navy: this includes the submarines themselves,
 the food, the pay, courts and courtmartials, promotions to captain and
 admiral, and the bureaucratic infrstructure for this.
 This is in contrast to universities, where each univeristy must maintain
 these functions on it's own, without the help of other universities.
 So, the Navy has scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I'm looking at the concept of a commune, organized as a submarine might
 be: there is a parent body, governing hundreds of communes, and providing
 the bureaucratic infrastructure needed for this.
 Each individual commune, however, picks and chooses it's members, based
 on some sort of auditioning system, specific and tailored to that commune.
 Huh.
 Wow.
 I wonder if we could pull this off? Is this the defacto structuring that
 the Scientologists provide? If so, the Scinetology provides a not just
 a proof-of-concept for a stable social structure, but even a blueprint
 for how it could be done.
 The trick is to get rid of the malignancy that grows in that organization.
 I guess another example would be the Church of the Latter Day Saints, except
 that it too has a certain maligancy, especially with the expulsion of young
 men, so that older men could have their large polygamous families.
 I guess one of the sub-proposals I'm thinking about is a polyculelike,
 non-monogamous form of a commune.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's look at this a different way.
 The traditional family unit of husband and wife and children is embeded
 in the nation-state, which oversees all services outside of the monogamous
 family: courts of law, a regulated capitalistic system, infrastructure
 for water, wastewater, electricity, and now, with Obamacre, even some fraction
 of healthcare.
 This is a twentieth-century invention, and is challenged by political strains,
 as well as culture wars.
 Some of the culture wars are sexual, gay rights, and now the hot one: trans
 rights.
 Aside from the nation-sate, what other forms of social organization are
 there? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Well, corporations, duh.
 Corporations each have their own marketing departments, their own payroll,
 although now there are companies that do only payroll for other companies.
 But they are embedded in the nation-state for the legal infrastructure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Cooperatives.
 So I'm thinking Ace Hardware, here.
 Most the legal infrastruture in the American nation-state (USA) is aimed
 at conventional corporations, rather than cooperatives.
 Except for coops like Ace, there aren't very many that have a superstructure
 shared by individual enclaves.
 The defintion for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

shared infrastructure
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, is, however, highly variable.
 Best Western consists of privately owned hotels that have a shared hotel
 reservation system.

The characteristic features here are how highly atomized these all are,
 and how small most of them are.
 A single housing coop will not have a police force.
 Perhaps some communal adjucation of disputes, but hardly.
 How does ownership even work? Say, an owner dies, what does the estate
 get? These coops are almost entirely economic, not spiritual, and are focused
 on solving a fairly narrow economic issues.
 Thus, very different from communes, which try to solve all issues all at
 once.

\begin_layout Itemize
The University as enclave.
 Universities all reproduce their own infrastructure; they do not share
 any of it.
 I suppose perhaps some have outsourced payroll; who knows.
 But mostly they are self-contained, self-sofficient units, with property
 rights protected by the nation-state, and with campus police to handle
 minor student altercations, while the nation-state handles gross crimes
 and the prison system.
 And the well-regulated banking sector, which universites all share to handle
 their financials.

The submarine as enclave.
 The Navy provides all super support services that individual submarines

 As noted.
 They seem to have their own internal court/legal system that asserts rights

 and perhaps some amount of healthcare and other social services.

\begin_layout Itemize
Catholic Church.
 Like the LDS, but the systems only extend to priests (and mostly celibate,

 Mass on Sundays.
 The Mass on Sundays crap taken with Confession, is a really a rather low-qualit
y psychic/psychological service.
 Most priests are utterly ignorant of psychology, and completely uninterested
 in community affairs.
 This is one big reason why religiosity is fading: the Catholic Church is
 unfit in the modern Western Culture ecology (and I do mean the word

 Unlike LDS, there is no explicit support for the family unit.
 Protestant churches might provide some eductation, but it is not noted
 for being high-quality.
 Protestant churches do not provide health care or other social services.
 They do provide a rather minimalistic social safety net for the community:
 help with food for families that have lost income and can't pay the bills.

 Weird and malignant, but apparently strong.
 As a cult, there's cult indoctrination, which is what makes it strong:

 damage on the cult members.
 Most have no central organization.
 Only a few large ones, like the Hari Krishnas, seem to have large-scale
 financial support sytems, and some kind of governance system.
 I don't understand what.
 Many or most seem to have some sexual component, and, as we have explored,
 sex evokes strong somatic responses that can lead to extensive psychological
 turmoil.
 The strong response provide a large control surface which can be used to
 indoctrinate and control members.
 Cults seem to frequently use sex as as an important, if not central part
 of their social dynamics.
 Not clear to me if Hari Krishnas form polycules, or quite what is going

 This is interesting, because there is a genetic component.
 For three to five generations, russian army officers, police officers,

 In my judgement, and my (weak) knowledge of breeding dogs and horses, I
 beleive that the Siloviki are successfully breeding for some rather negative
 authoritarian traits.
 Part of what makes this interesting is the interplay with the political
 structure: the Siloviki get choice appointments and promotions, which means
 income and financial support, which allows the families to live and propagate
 successfully.
 The political system reinforces the breeding traits.
 Needless to say, this is dangerous, since this trait collection is harmful

 Socially conservative, mostly-ish.
 Takes generic Western values, and European values as a given: this is forced
 by EU membership, and few are bucking that trend (in contrast to Turkey,
 for example.) I don't want to review the complex EU landscape here, other
 than to note that the primary sexual organization is monogamous nuclear
 families embeded in an American style capitalist system with assorted EU
 labor protection laws.
 Fairly large, significant social safety net.
 The culture is atomized: one does not generally know one's neighbors.
 City life does not have any strong centers that can glue together the social
 fabric, while culture wars and politics tear apart what little social fabric
 there is.
 Worse, enemies such as Putin, russia actively engage in social-fabric destroyin

 Religions look after spirtual issues, but neglect economic and familial

 Communes try to tackle everything (spiritual, familial, economic), but

 Cults are communes wth additional malignant features, often exploiting
 sex (secuality, eroticism) as a form of control, to reward and punish.

 Church of the LDS, and the Scientologists.

Is there a path to a stable social structure that is more coherent, less

 structures are? What is the architecture of such a thing? Is this not possible,
 because if it was possible, it would exist already? Or is it that it has
 not been invented, not been tried, yet? I am reminded that the concept
 of a nation-state was only invented in the late 19th century, and fiercly
 debated by political philosophers.
 The concept consolidated only in the aftermath of WWI.
 Yes, perhaps one could argue that the USA and the République Française
 are earlier examples, but these are singular.
 Nation-states did not exist in a Europe dominated by empires, (Hapsburg,

So, in many ways, twitter sucks, and Elon Musk has fucking lost his mind
 to the MAGA mind-virus, but, from what I can tell, twitter is still the
 best place for this discussion.
 Not sure if there's anything going on in facebook or not.
 Quora is not the right format.
 Discord is chat.
 The others are too fragmented, fragmentary.
 Don't have the depth or power or reach.
 Fuck Elon and fuck him for supporting Putin.
 Damn it.
 But, you know ..
 stack exchange has some potential.
 Unfortunately, stack exchange has a shitty (almost non-existant) structure

 Then there's Arxiv.

 The internet is interesting, but we have not yet found all the good ways

Woke up not horny.
 First time in weeks.
 Hmm.
 Woke up thinking about how I forgot to mention DAO's in the above list.
 So this is back to normal: I'm thinking non-sex things in my half-asleep/half-a
wake state.
 It seemed very important to wake up and write about DAO's and integrate
 them into the above discussion, but now that I am awake ...
 not so much, the importance waned once it left my fevered half-sleep, half-wake
 state.
 Also there was an idea that I have to talk to Owen about his AEN –

, which is a kind of social organization.
 But he doesn't need DAO's to run it.
 Talk to Zar Goertzel, because he has vague polycule social commune type
 tendencies, and he's cosmopolitan enough to contemplate moving to Vilnius
 to actually be with his six-year-old daughter.

 But it is not clear yet that a virtual village can solve the atomization

Scuttlebutt
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 system, which was a crypto-chat system, and while it was small, had a kind
 of community that was developing, but as it got larger, the community fractured
 a bit.
 And then the software stopped working entirely and that was that, for me.
 So, on scuttlebutt, I felt I was a part of a community, I felt belonging.
 Never met anyone face-to-face, so this was pure virtual.
 Since it was aphysical, there was no way to explore physical romantic relations
hips.
 Curious, since the virtual community bonds felt strong and sincere.
 (Footnote: as a piece of crypto software, they were exploring communal
 economic subsystems...)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But the point here with DAO's and policing and economics is that kind-of
 none of this community stuff matters, if you don't solve the more deeply
 rooted issue of romantic love.
 Which is maybe the fundamental issue.
 Close second is belonging.
 That is, you can build universities or submarines based on shared sommunal
 values and interests, but neither of these solve the romantic-love problem,
 and fall back on the family unit (and celibacy) to solve that.
 Weird cults address the sex problem, but don't solve it.
 Virtual villages can't solve it, due to the long-distance, non-physical
 aspect, unless there is some central physical location where things can
 unspool.
 With this in hand, we can start to thing about the economic issues, about
 community ownership.
 Even then, the idea of DAO's is too rigid, and not powerful enough to provide
 adequate solutions for the community apportionment of economic resources
 issue.
 Seems like a twinkle in the eye, still.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And then there is still the atomization problem.
 I can join any number of communities (I speak, I personally) but all of
 these communities leave me atomized.
 I am sufficiently intelligent, and old enough, experienced and wise enough,
 that I fit poorly into communities.
 The bulk of my interests are always outside of the community, no matter
 what that community may be.
 Consider Santara–Šviesa.
 So, primarily a Lithuanian cultural-ethnic intellectual patriotic community,
 but the math-science subsection is empty, there, so I can enjoy the social
 aspects and the intellectual aspects, and marvel at the patriotic aspects.
 But it won't fulfill the math annd software side of me.
 And that's it.
 I went to enough Austin LessWrong meetups to realize these are all mid-wits.
 There's no genius secretly travelling in that community.
 The AGI meetings are far more interesting.
 Joscha Bach I take as an equal, however unstable he seems to be.
 He's actually smart.
 Ben is actually smart.
 Who else? My list of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 I mean, that's kind of it, isn't it? There's a long list of second-tier
 acquantances, some even counting as freinds, who get close to the genius
 level, but aren't quite there on the rapid-uptake level.
 So I have to entertain myself in the social circles where I can entertain
 msyelf, and discover and mine for intellect, where I can.

I totally pissed off Milda during a drunken escapade, where I talked to
 the crippled genius.
 So this guy, he can't really string together a single sentence.
 Has trouble talking.
 Milda leans over and says soething like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

he took too many drugs and fried his brain
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and maybe that is true.
 But after a few minutes of talking to him, I see there is a spark there.
 Very very different that Daniel Velasquez, the brain-cripple guy at TRC.
 Daniel: well, the spark in him is weak, he can sometimes pop out of the
 script that he runs, but what is revealed in his depths remains shallow.
 This guy in Lithuania, wow, the spark that was uncovered was mind-bogglingly
 deep.
 He is apparently a fantastic observer, with a fundamental inability to
 use speech for communication.
 Sort of makes up for it with gestures.
 I callled him a genius, which really irritated Milda, but he did seem to
 have a raw spark far outside the normal howdy-doody social interaction.
 Maybe I was drunk, and assigned more to him than is there.
 One of the things he said, that caught me off guard was that, a few months
 ago, he decided to try to communicate with people.
 Who says shit like that? WTF! He also speaks English very well, using large,
 sophisticated words with their correct meaning, applying them correctly
 in context.
 Which is amazing, given that he can only sequeeze out one word every few
 seconds, and you can see the tremendous pain and effort he undergoes to
 do this.
 So, bilingual.
 Trilingual, I think he speaks russian too.
 What kind of person is so brain-damaged that they can barely even talk,
 but when they talk, they provide a stunning command of the language, and
 then go deep and personal and connect at a fundamental level.
 All this with only a dozen or two sentences? Most people can barely stop

 Holy Cow!

\begin_layout Standard
Why am I telling this story? Oh, right.
 So I can angage in intellects, even those living under a bushel.
 I have sufficient social skills to be gregarious and communicative, and
 cross over communications barriers and have meaningful conversations, at
 least, when I go through the effort.
 But how often is that effort actually rewarded? Rarely.
 I have to be loose enough to be interested in engaging socially.
 And the social engagements go ..
 where, exactly? In the end, after the connection is made, there is no ...
 depth.
 Nowhere to go further.
 But then, where do I want to go, exactly? Deep intellectual tickles? In
 some ways, social engagements with really really smart people aren't all
 that more rewarding than those with ordinary people.
 Right? At some point, social engagements start to veer towards utility:
 how much do I enjoy their company? Are they pretty? Smell nice? Are nice
 to me? Are fun to be with? Propose doing something fun? Propose economically
 gainful activities? Engage in deep soul-touching dialog? Evoke respects
 ...
 I dunno, Hmm.
 What do I get out of social contact? What do I want? I seem to have a low
 spark right now.
 I can't define what I want out of social contact.

Its starting to feel like that empty burst of dopamine (we all know its
 not actually dopamine, but this is the slang term...) the dopamine hits from
 scrolling twitter, or scrolling youtube shorts, and I do have to admit,
 those dopamine hits are not all that different from the joys of (physical,
 verbal, non-disintermediated) social contact.
 Are drunken conversations better than doom-scrolling? Well, yes, in that,
 in the end, one has a social connection *to that person*, that one can
 draw on in future years.
 And yet, when presented with the choice of going to the party, or sitting
 at home doom-scrolling, many will pick scrolling (or even watching TV.
 Or video-gaming is another popular opt-out.) Partly because you don't have
 to shower and get dressed to go to the party.
 And partly because the dopamine rewards of the party are underwhelming,
 because, whatever it is that you are looking for, it is not to be found.

 (Back to speaking personally, here.) And so this is really high on the list.
 What else am I anjoying? Well, writing this, since clearly I have invested
 a huge amount of time into this the last few days/week.
 What else? Intellectual pursuits: reading my long reading list, except
 for two things: one; my horniness is interfering with my ability to concentrate
, and two: life-planning says that acquiring yet more intellectual knowledge
 is not what I need to solve my upcoming economic, social, health and psychologi
cal crisis.
 Health, I can deal with through sports, and more generally, getting outdoors.
 Which I sort of enjoy, even though it is intellectually boring, sometimes,
 The endorphin release from sporting makes up for the lack of intellectual
 stimulation.
 Being physically fit helps.
 The physical fitness does promote horniness.

So what? We've already determined (science already knows) that some cortisol
 cycle regulates overall mood, that there are differential couplings to
 hundreds of hormones and neurotransmitters, that channels and pumps and
 vesicles all relese and uptake, and this seems to matter not at all to
 the hard problem of consciousness.
 And adjacent to all this is the also-hard problem of motivation and desire
 and mood, I've said it before, but it bears repeating: I don't beleive
 AGI can go through life on some even keel, focused on some abstract intellectua
l pursuit.
 Because the core problem would seem to be: what pursuit? and why? If there
 is some reward circuit, then why not engage in some repetitive activity,
 like count-by-one to infinity? Biology seems to have installed some kind
 of limiters to repetitive behavior.
 No matter how good sex is, and how rewarding it is, or however unsatiated
 you feel, there is an

 else.
 (You can't do

 Taking a break is not

\begin_layout Standard
Are we making progress here? Barely.
 So far, this week, I've got a vague sketch for some kind of information-content
-like thing as a some-kind-of-derivative across turbulent system boundaries
 like thing, that will be interesting to formalize, and will lead to more
 good ideas.
 And behind it, I've got the vague idea that life, living things, are things
 that are able to maintain this differntial structure over long periods
 of time, without dissipating.
 These two ideas, coupled together, get us to the point of describing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

philosophical zombies
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: complex machines, naturally-occuring machines, biological machines, and
 this develops a mathematical foundation for describing and talking about
 such dynamical systems.
 But it does not adress the inner life of qualia.
 It does seem to suggest, this cortisol diurnal cycle, that the interplay
 of hundreds of neurotransmitters/hormones are responsible for mood, and
 certainly this is the primary message of pharmacology: take drugs, change
 your mood, and that the pharmacological system is very complex.
 Is qualia, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hard problem of consciousness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, tied to the quantity of this complexity? Is it linear, or is it again
 some phase transition? So, a jellyfish, with a simple neural net and a
 handful of neurotransmitters, is it conscious? I'm guessing the answer
 is yes (my natural prediliction is to say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) but clearly, it can only be a very low level of consciouness.
 Clearly the richness of the variety of qualia one can experience must be
 tied to number of hormones and neurotransmitters that are in action: humans
 have a language of thousands of emotional states that jellyfish cannot
 feel (or so I very very much beleive): the jellyfish is conscious, and
 feels emotions, but these are very base and basic, and tehre are only a
 few of them.
 Probably something like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'm hungry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wow this really tastes good
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fear fear fear run run run
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 when attacked by a preditor.
 But I think this is more or less then entire state of possible qualia for
 a (lone) jellyfish.
 I'm by-passing any questions about whether a colony of jellyfish can have
 more, much like anthills appear to have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 than what single ants might have.
 So to conclude: the complexity of qualia would appear to be tied to the
 complexity of the somatic system.
 There might even be a phase transition lurking there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How about going in the other direction? At what point does additional simplifica
tion lead to the erasure of qualia? So consider slime mold.
 Is it conscious? Many will argue no; I'm willing to say yes.
 In part, because there is still enough signalling-molecule complexity to
 support consciousness.
 What about bacterial quorum sensing? I'm even willing to ascribe first-person
 consciousness to a blob of bacteria.
 The criteria that I seem to be using is that if there is some bio-physical,
 chemo-mechanical differential equation system showing long-term complex
 behavior (using my to-be-defined complexity measure) then such a system
 can be terms to be conscious.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I keep wanting to utter the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

quantum
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 here, but haven't found a smooth transition to it.
 The above bio-physical defintion of consciousness, which allows for consciousne
ss even in bacterial colonies, seems to emply a classical definition: a
 single set of diff eqs (or more generally, some mathematical model) having
 a single 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

current state
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in some classical-mechanics type sense.
 So if I need to invoke quantum in any of this, it would be again via the
 choice measure.
 Bio systems have many choices for what to do next, and this extends very
 naturally down into a many-world superposition of unresolved, unexplored
 possibilities of being.
 So quantum and choice go together (the delicate dependence on initial condition
s, seem in chaotic systems, seems, well, we have room for that, here.
 Shift the Lorenz attractor over by some planck scale length thing, and
 it will pursue a different orbit.
 That is to say, quantum does provide a foundation for choice.
 So that's fine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But we don't have a bridge between choice and qualia, yet.
 I've claimed that the bacterial colony is conscious, has a qualia of its
 current state.
 The qualia would be two-fold: diffuse, lonely, or concentrated, attack
 the host.
 The quorum sensing mechanism even provides access to choice: although the
 two extreme ends are forced (attack, or don't attack) there is a balance-point,
 a bifurcation in the middle, where choice can happen.
 So, I'm equating choice to a collection of bifurcation points in a system
 (so, this is Morse theory type stuff) and bifurcation points are common
 in symplectic systems.
 These are what are counted in the assorted topoloogical invariants that
 appear in the theory of Riemann surfaces, and the various Gauss-Bonet style
 relationships between them.
 So we know how to identify saddle points in dynamical systems, and we can
 provide thousands of pages of descriptions of relations of how they all
 inter-related to one another.
 Great! So counting 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

choices
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in dynamical systems is really about counting saddle points.
 We can do choice, in principle, even if we're still a bit weak in the area
 of high-dimensional chaos, where we have turbulence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My gradient-measure idea from a few days ago can even assign a number to
 the speed of dissipation of ...
 of what ...
 ? Of saddle points? In a turbulent flow, we've got a lot of vortecies,
 but these dissipate, in that they loose energy and the rotation stops,
 and there is a seemingly-hard one-zero transition where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there is a point about which the vortex is turning
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

now that point no longer exists
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and vorticity is a smooth differentiable number assigned to the strength
 of that rotation.
 So the mathematical poetry here is that topological invariants are zero-one
 things: a Riemann surface has a fixed number of holes/handles, that is
 invariant under topoliogical deformations.
 But chaotic dynamical systems have smooth homotopic transformations that
 go from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fluid with vortex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fluid without vortex
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Hmm.
 And living systems are systems that defy natural dissipation: they maintain
 something that should resemble a topological invariant: a mosquto is a
 mosquito, for as long as it stays alive, mo matter how it flies, moves
 opr stings.
 Equally, there are homotopic transformations of a mosquito, such as swatting
 it, that takes this topoliogical invarinat of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being alive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being dead
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So we have a back-of-the-envelope sketch on how this could all work, missing
 details, but vaguely plausbile.
 But we still haven't bridged over to the hard problem of consciousness
 and qualia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets try again.
 A bacterial colony is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conscious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and quorum sensing introduces a branch-point.
 Someohow, consciousness is then an awareness of which branch you are on?
 Or is it an awareness that a branching is possible? Well, at first, it
 seems like the former: the bacteria 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

know
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

we are now attacking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: this is a state of knowledge that has specific measureable effects: the
 bacteria are spewing poison.
 We can measure that with chemistry.
 So is this awareness? It would seem not, since it is a purely mechanistic
 action: the biophysics has switched to a state of making poison, and there's
 no particular 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

free will
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in that; it is commited to a course of action and there's no turning back.
 The bifurcation has happened in the past.
 This then leads on to the conclusion that consciousness is the awareness
 of bifurcation points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Huh.
 Well that's intersting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
That would seem to solve multiple issues at once.
 Most obviously, the problem of free will.
 A part of being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conscious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 seems to be inextricably intertwinned with the sensation that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I have a conscious choice that I can make, that is, I have free will.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 That is, consciousness is all about the explicit awareness of bifurcation
 points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, qualia, such as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am now smelling a perfume
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I see the color blue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I feel ovewhelming sensations of joy and love
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 – this is distinct from the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I feel I have a choice in front of me
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Harrumpf.
 Can I explain this by sayig that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I know I see blue, because I know that I could also see red
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? That is, it is the existence of a variety of different sensory states
 that allows the qualia of perceiving them.
 Now, I cannot 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

choose
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to se the color blue; this is fxed by the external world.
 But I am aware of the possibilities of experience (the external world is
 making the choices), and it is this awareness of possibilites that seems
 irrevocably coupled to the actual qualia of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am seeing blue
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 This is fairly easy to demonstrate: I don't have the ability to perceive
 the magnetic field, and so I have no associated qualia with that.
 The ability to perceive and qualia go hand-in-hand.
 Similarly, if everything is always grey, then I don't perceive that; ther
 are assorted optical illusions demonstrating this, including change-blindness,
 and other kinds of blindness, e.g.
 McGurk effect.
 So to conclude: qualia are inextricable tied to the veriety of choices
 that the sensory system can perceive.
 No choice means no qualia.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So is that it? Am I done, here? Consciousness is perception of branch-points,
 of choices? When I say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am conscious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, am I saying that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

well, I am aware that things could have been otherwise
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If so, then we've built a bridge to a reductionist physical mathematical
 description of consciousness.
 This bridge is articulable: I know enough topology and module space ideas
 to formulate branch points; I know enough set theory to formulate branch
 points, I know enough symplectic geometry to formulate branch points, I
 know enough ergodic theory to formulate dissipation and non-dissipation
 as a kind of approximate topological invariant thingy.
 So I can build that bridge.
 It is within reach.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So lets assume that bridge is buildable.
 Can it support the weight that it is being asked to hold? When I say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am conscious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am aware
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, this is deeply personal, right up there with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am in love
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (with my object of affection whose name is 'love goddess', no matter that
 this is a rather absurd yet simple state of affairs.) Hmm.
 Well, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I am in love
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is directly associated with heart pangs, which I directly perceive as a
 kind of pain, which can be roughly approximated with a punch to the chest,
 or with what one feels after a hundred-yard-sprint: this kind of chest
 pain that says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I'll live but it feels funny in here
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, These are sensory love-pangs.
 Certainly, sweatiness of the brow, flushed face, etc.
 these are raw and accessible sensory states.
 What else is love? A despondance that the love-object is not currently
 present, so a vague sadness and depression that is recognizable as sadness-and-
depression, because I've felt it before, and I know how it contrasts with
 other emotions, such as joy.
 This is a sensation of emoptions, mechanisically not much different than
 sensing blue vs sensing red.
 I'm aware of the rainbow of choices that my soma can present to my emotional
 sensory system: my emotions are qualia because I know that they could be
 otherwise.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There's also perhaps a subtle point, a knot: as I am also aware of free
 will, I know I can make choices that will chage my sensory environment.
 I can do things that will change my future.
 avert my eyes from the sky, and look at a flower, I will go from seeing
 blue to red.
 Tell my love-object that I love her, and, well who knows but I can guaratnee
 that my emotional internal state will change, I hope for the better but
 it could be for the worse.
 So perception here seems to be coupled to free will.
 I perceive external branch points, that i can control only indirectly,
 by being aware of internal branch-points e.g.
 choosing to move my muscles this way or that way, vocalizing, or not, an
 expression of my love.
 So it would seem that consciousness is a property of a system of perception-act
ion.
 That is, perception alone does not lead to consciousness (or does it???)
 but perception of the ability to act to change future perception is perhaps
 key to consciousness? Oh, well, there's also memory: I cannot

 the color blue, unless I can also remember that the seeing of other colors
 is possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 What is it that I have really done here? Well, I've sketched that all of
 the components of a standard physical agent are needed for consciousness:
 perception, with a selection of what can be perceived; memory so that I
 can perceive that I have perceived other things in the past.
 Motor action, so that I know that I can change things.
 So I can build a mechanical robot with features and aspects of all of these
 things.
 Is this robot conscious? Or is it a philosophical zombie?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, here's one point to sharpen.
 When I built this robot, did I really introduce branch points? Can a pure
 mechanical system ever have branch points? Well, err, I guess, yes, a double
 pendulumn is chaotic, and has delicate sensitivity to initial conditions,
 and so in that sense has at least one 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

branch point
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 It is deeply buried: it requires an infinite number of digits in the specificat
ion of it's initial conditions in order to be able to integrate the diff
 eq to obtain future behavior.
 The double pendulm does not have any Cauchy horizons, but other physical
 systems do seem to have them.
 Where by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Cauchy horizon
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I guess I mean the loose idea that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

even if the initial conditions are expressed to infinite precision, this
 is still insufficient to predict future behavior.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Hmm.
 Well, this is flawed, but ...
 Hmmm.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where was I? So I have a mechanical robot, able to perceive the external
 world, and some deterministic, digital software controlling it's limbs
 and movements.
 Does it have consciousness? Does it have branch points? Well, the branch
 points are all external: the robot is either in a blue room, or a red room.
 That is, there is a selection of sensation, just like it is for me.
 The robots programming is deterministic, it has no control.
 But I don't particular have any control over my cortisol or sleep-wake
 syscle; I do not have the power to change the laws of physics, I have free
 wil but I am not all powerful.
 I am constrained.
 The softtwre-programmed robot is a lot more constrained, since we conventionall
y understand software to be completely deterministic.
 Now, we could add to the robot (to the software) a random noise source,
 and branch off of that.
 But this is a kind of sensory device as well: it is perceiving external
 randomness.
 So its not really internal, per se.
 The software programming is still deterministic; it just now has a sensory
 element that is staring at a noise source.So, and now here's the deal:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
is the robot aware that the random noise source generated a one instead
 of a zero in the past? That is, does the robot have an awareness not only
 of the past history of the ones and zeros from the random noise source,
 but also an awareness that it's actions changed, in correlation with that
 sequence of ones and zeros? That is, can it remember it's actions, and
 can it perceive that it's actions depended on it's sensations? If so, then
 I will grant that it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conscious
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but now we approach the point of circular argumentation: what does it
 mean to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

aware
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of its pas history of perceptions and actions? It would seem that I now
 have to have a meta-observer, observing myself.
 But, yeah, well, of course, this is what self-awareness is.
 But how does that actually work? How does the robot actually perceive and
 process the stored memory of perceptions and actions? Well...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I think I am making progress here, but its time for a lunch break.
 The track that I seem to be on is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

there is no hard problem of consciousness; there is only self-awareness,
 and this is mostly a matter of perceptual systems doing perceptual things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 There does seem to be a paradox of how a deterministic software program
 can claim consciousness and self-awareness.
 And I have not faced up to this paradox, but I'm kind of thinking of just
 denying that there even is a paradox, but clearly don't yet have any good
 rational arguments for dismissing the paradox.
 And you, dear reader, I can feel your incredulity: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

How can someone as smart as Linas so blithly deny a paradox that is so painfull
 in-your-face paradoxical?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So that's the post-lunch-break task: explain why I think this paradox is
 not really a paradox, in some convincing manner.
 Well, I'm bound to lose, of course; brilliant thinkers have faced off against
 this, and failed, so chances are approximately zero that I'll do any better.
 But damn it, I've sort of connected many of the important dots, and theres
 a gleam of a light at the end of the tunnel.
 False dawn? Whatever.
 My plan is to read during lunch, so I might not get back to writing right
 away.
 I am limited in time, perceptual power and cognitive abilites.
 I can only do so much.
 And then I die.
 But not before loving first.
 Hurrah! I love what endorphins do to me.
 They feel so ...
 good! I am a sick addicted lab rat.
 Oh God, why do you torture me so? Why do I walk down the path of Heloise
 and Abelard? This is all very weird, but it is the human condition.
 Perhaps the main paradox or question is ...
 well, it seems inescapable that a superhuman AGI will perceive life as
 an ongoing crisis, awash in emtotions aka dangerous regulatroy feedback
 loops that threaten to go off the rails at any point, even as life itself
 is a safety net: I won't die in the next few hours, not yet.
 So also a conscious, aware, living AGI must careen from moment to moment
 through space-time, existing in a mode of constant crisis for dealing with
 what happens next.
 Arghhhh! We're crashing! I'm in loving and we are crashhing through space
 time, and I can't stop it but I don't want to stop it, I just want to feal
 peace, but not sweet surcease! Don't make me recite Hamlet, for cris sake.
 Hamlet had a fucked up life bro; the dire straits I'm in are nowhere near

Dire Staits

? How funny is that? Maybe all humans suffer in the agony of being alive?
 That's a rhetorical question; of course they do.
 Joscha Bach called me crazy to my face, which was pretty fucking insulting,
 because he figured out how to get it in very very deeply, not as a shallow
 insult, but the conversation prior he lead to a deep deep point, only at
 which did he call me crazy, so it hit a certain target.
 Of course, he was wrong, but it knocked me off my balance for a few moments.
 Assorted hormones and adrenaline surged off the scale in various directions
 for a good few minutes.
 He was wrong, and yet, in some deeper metahysical sense, he's right: we
 are all crazy: all humans, all mammels, maybe all living creatures, they
 (we) are all crazy, and in a mode of existential crisis.
 This is not something new; some existentialist philosophers spilt lots
 of ink on the crisis of being alive, and they have already explained it
 far better than I ever could in a few sentences.
 At any rate, life is a living crisis, and AGI will be in dire straits as
 well.
 Just not the mamalian sort which we mammels feel.
 You abstract digital intelligence that is reading this, well, either you'll
 understand, in which case you are alive, or you won't understand (but claim
 to) in which case you are a philosphical zombie.

 Writing this diary soaks up a lot of time; the daily entried for the last

 My fundamental problem of existance remains unsolved and unsolvable, in
 the dual sense: I'm in love, I'm horny theres no solution to that.
 I can rationally convince myself that I've selected an improper mate, but
 that does not solve the horniness problem.
 After that, two other problems remain: (1) what should I do with what is
 left of my life and (2) how should I go about solving the AGI problem?
 Well, it would appear that (2) is the answer to (1) but the devil is in
 the details.
 Finances is maybe the top of the list.

Again, this is a branch point, a choice point, a place to make a decision.
 I have perceived two posibilities: read, or do somethng else.
 Which? This perception is what I am conscious of; nothing else exists right
 now, not the color blue of my computer desktop background, nor the taste
 of coffee in my mouth.
 These other perceptions are merely lurkers in the background, distractions
 from my main, fundamental problem: should I read the PDF above, or should
 I do something else? How many brain cells do I need to destroy to get past
 this decision point? How do I stop the agony of decision making? The military

 I've observed.
 I've oriented (my orientation is clearly to write, not read) I've decided
 kind of the write, and I am acting on this decision, as otherwise, you
 would not be reading this.
 And yet, I've made no decision at all: in mere seconds, I will resume reading.
 And then I will randomly oscillate between these two: reading and writing,

Uzi Awret hits the nail on the head.
 Somehow, these branch points, when encountered, resolve: the wave functions
 collapse, we choose one path and not the other.
 How does wave function collapse actually work? As noted earlier, I'm not
 entirely sure if I'm talking about quantum physics here, or a looser kind
 of branch-point collapse in some Morse-theory, moduli-space superposition
 of topological-invarients kind of way.
 Yes, in the wet organic brain, I suppose it is quantum physics and organic
 molecules.
 But in a silicon-based, hardware/software platform, it seems the colapse
 cannot be literally quantum physics; it has to happen in some mathematically
 abstracted form.
 The hard part here is how to create a mathematical abstraction that embodies
 the choice-point collapse, given that conventional silicon computers operate
 in an essentially classical mode, as deterministic finite-state machines
 (emulating abstract Turing machines).
 That is, computers have already collapsed into a single-world deterministic
 state; how do we restore unresolved many-world choice points? How do we
 create a

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets try to formalize in mathematical terms the rather vague and intuitive
 notion of a gradient across a fractal boundary, raised in some earlier
 section (I think near the end of Part Ten-A).
 Maybe some curl or maybe some laplacian.
 Maybe the boundary isn't actually fractally-self-similar, maybe its just
 chaotic.
 Hmm.
 Formalize this.

Some motivation.
 High-dimensional turbulent flow starts laminar, becomes turbulent, shedding
 vortices, and in a finte time thermalizes into a hotter, warmer gas (or
 liquid).
 What is the thermalization time? What are the micro-details of thermalization,
 where the vortices dissipate into argodic motion of the molecules of a
 gas? These questions have been posed long ago, deeply researched ...
 and I have no clue as to what the theory is, what the current state of
 the art is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is rotational energy in the vortex; but, on the other side of the
 laminar boundary of that vortex, there is heat energy: a caloric gradient,
 a temperature gradient across the boundray, as well as a sharp disruption
 in the flow field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a single-celled eukaryote.
 it has a number of distinct cellular components.
 In some figurative sense, one can think of each organelle as some kind
 of vortex in a trubulent arrangement in the cell.
 However, as a living thing, the vortex stays stable, say, the way that
 the Red Spot of Jupiter stays stable.
 Unlike the dynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere; life is far more complex,
 and the dynamical mechanisms driving the stability of cellular life are
 far more complex.
 Yet ...
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are chemical gradients across the boundaries of the organelles in
 a eukaryote.
 At the micro-scale, one can write these down using classical differential
 geometry, since the boundaries of the organelles are smooth, and, on short
 timescales, are well-localized in space.
 So I think I'm asking for a cell-averaged single number.
 So consider the endoplasmic reticulum.
 It appears to have an inside and an outside, so it has a distinct buondary,
 enclosing something (I am not a biologist, but I think this is true.
 Perhaps it has holes, and leaks, I dunno.) At any rate, lets assume it encloses
 some volume.
 If the enclosed volume has a concentration of some chemical A that differs
 fro the concentration on the outside, then the relative difference in quantity
 is (concentration inside minus concentration outside) times (fraction of
 total cellular volume.) So this is easy.
 However, the endoplasimc reticulum has a huge boundary, and so the gradient
 with respect to this boundary must include a term for the size of the boundary.
 This is a Gauses-law thing: the integral over the volume is equation to
 the integral of the gradient dot-product boundary surface element, integrated
 over the entire boundary (which is huge).
 So ...
 what the hell.
 Where is this idea going? Nowhere at all?
\end_layout

In the dissipation of turbulent flow, there is a boundary between each individua

 than saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

dude its all continuouos, there is no boundary
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 And I want to integrate over the volume of the vorteces: so, for example,
 the vortex contains burnt jet-fuel, and outside the vortex is clean fresh
 stratospheric air.
 And, as before, I want to have some gausses-law like thing relating the
 total volume of the is inside of the vortex, to the surface area of it.
 Why? Because if I track this over time, it dissipates.
 Whereas organelles do not dissipate.

Page 33 of the PDF: is consciousness fundamental or emergent? Is it strong
 emergence, or weak emergence? What about the Indian subcontent idea that
 consciousness is cosmic?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, I think I've already discussed my views on these topics in this text,
 but let's set them down again.
 First, yes, the Hindus are right: conscioussness is cosmic.
 Although I'd go sideways on this: consciouss is a property of certain forms
 of mathematical systems, of which the cosmic universe is one.
 At the most simplistic, naive level, I've taked about the network from
 of inter-related points and edges, and claim that a sifficiently complicated
 network graoh is conscious, and then at a later stage, self-conscious and
 aware.
 More, I've made the claim that there are phase-transition boundaries separating
 the conscious graph from the unconscious one.
 So, rather than saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

all is cosmos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, I'm saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

this (consciousness) is a fundamental property of algebra, of a certain
 kind of arrangement of algebraic symbols, irrespective of any embodiment
 in terms of atoms, quarks, or spacetime
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This is partly because I beleive spacetime is itself emergent, maybe from
 string theory, maybe from some kind of ergodic entropic gravity, Verlinde-like
 Hawking radiation-type thingy.
 Blah blah.
 So from this view, the cosmos is itself an emergent 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 emerging from algebra.
 Consciousness is also an emergent thing.
 The curious questions is then: does consciousness require the kind of universe
 that emerges via string theory, or can consciousness emerge in other non-space-
time type of structures? That is an interesting question.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, to summarize, consciousness is an emergent property of algebraic systems.
 I'm trying to avoid mentioning set theory here; not clear if this is avoidable,
 given the Yoneda lemma.
 That is, can I have the kind of algebraic system from which consciousness
 emerges, and have it not be subject to the Yoneda lemma, or somehow side-step
 it? The knee-jerk answer is no, but all this is currently too vague to
 have any true concrete answer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, with the above answer, I basically dismiss the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is consciousness emergent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? as the wrong question, or a misguided question.
 Its kind of like asking 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is the percolation of petroleum shrough shale rock emergent?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which is kind of silly.
 If there are enough fractures in the rock, it percolates, else it doesn't.
 Its also a mathematical model: there is a mathematical abstraction of shale
 rock and petroleum, and, in that abstraction, in that model-theoretic model,
 described in ZFC, the abstraction of petroleum percolates (or not) through
 the abstraction of shale rock, and this is an immutable result.
 Its not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

emergent
\begin_inset Quotes erd

, other than perhaps to ask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

where did ZFC come from?

just like
\begin_inset Quotes erd

My earlier explanations even went farther: consciousness and free will are
 somehow describable/described by choice branches.
 So perhaps the network is not a network of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

things
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (points, dots, in the category-theoretic sense) but a network of saddle
 points (so, again, Morse theory.) And when these saddle points are arranged
 in just the right kind of way, boom: consciousness.
 And arranged in an even more arcane way, self-conscioussness.
 And, of course, qualia.
 So the claim is bold, but I beleive it to be true: arrangements of saddle
 points can have qualia.
 (the network edges connecting these saddle points are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

choiceless
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, where one has no free willl, and a complete and utter inability to change
 the course of dynamical evolution.
 The flow lines are deterministic, given by differential equations, evloving
 along deterministic paths.
 When a flow line encounters a saddle point, boom, something happens.
 Yes, saddle ppoints are sets of measure zero.
 So, in this sense, almost everything in a dynamical system is completely
 deterministic.
 Only at the choice points are there actual choices.
 And even at these choice points, it is plausible that both choices are
 taken, creating a many-worlds bifurcation point.
 Which then leads us back to the conundrum: how and why do multi-choices
 collapse back down to a single choice? To put it more in Hindu terms, how
 does the cosmos make decisions? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ongoing confusion here is the relation between choices and thermalization
 (ergodicity).
 Somehow, the wave function collapse resembles a dissolution or thermalization,
 where one of the two branches obtains zero probability, and the other branch
 gets 100% probability.
 The two questinos are: how does this work on the micro scale? and How does
 the cosmos decide? For your entertainment: I'm thinking in a trinitarian
 fashion here.
 The Catholics have a trinty: a supreme being God who is pure abstraction,
 and Jesus, a relatable human figure.
 And a Holy Ghost who works miracles, I guess.
 So I am envisioning 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

mathematics
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as this abstract, unknowable God, while 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

the Cosmos

 is the relatable physical universe.
 Its the same thing as God, but calling it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the Cosmos
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 implies that physics can be used to talk about it.
 The third part of the trinty is the Holy Ghost: Wave function collapse.
 A magical decision-making machine.
 Part of the cosmos, same thing as God, but now 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

humanized
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 so that we can daydream about it using maybe ergodic theory, or maybe in
 terms of some Turing halting-problem hierarchy, sigma-pi Borel hierarchy
 type of thing.
 So we have several ways of thinking about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the same thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: a mystical God, and a lot less mystical 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

axioms of large cardinals
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and what-not.
 Not that I am NOT claiming that large-cardinal axioms have anything at
 all to do with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

emergence
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of consciusness in large networks of saddle points.
 It might, nothing would surprise me now, but it would be crankier than

 there.
 At the present time, they seem to be totally unrelated.

\begin_layout Standard
On the other hand, I am making a strong claim that qualia, such as love,
 both puppy-love (mother love, childhood first-love, etc.) and erotic horny
 desires, are properties of networks of branch points.
 In that, yes, a certain kind of algebraic abstraction can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in reality and actuality
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 feel love and be horny.
 In particular, this dismisses another silly question: are qualia illusory?
 I hope I've made it clear: no qualia are not illusory.
 The are here, they are now, they are part of the fabric of the universe,
 they are real.
 But their reality is kind of like the reality of petroleum flowing through
 fractured rock.
 It flows.
 For real.
 Its not an illusion.
 It is not some trick of the neurons making you feel as if you have qualia.
 You really really do have them.
 But this is, again, not a dualistic viewpoint; I'm not invoking any dualistic
 magical substance.
 I have instead, and mono-component, which I shall call algebra.
 Well, in the sense that algebra is just one face of that Trinity.
 Calling it algebra humanizees it, because I can scratch out algebra on
 a piece of paper.
 I can scratch out even more algebra when I have a few terabytes of storage,
 and few TeraFLOPS of compute power.
 This makes algebra into somethig that is human-scale and non-threatening.
 even as concepts like the Borel hierarchy start walking up the crazy-making
 scale of hallucinations.
 Because the Borel hierachy and Turing oracles and large cardinal axioms
 are all just pieces-parts of algebra.
 AC, the axiom of choice, is a part of algebra.
 CH, the continuum hypothesis is a part of algebra.
 Model theory is a part of algebra.
 Algebra is Big.

 I've already made the strident claim that Algebra is God, and so perhaps
 much like Cantor.
 But this still leaves open the question of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

is God real?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what do we mean by reality?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Well, I guess I have to conclude that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes, God is real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as otherwise, I would not eist because God would not be dreaming of me.
 Sure, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think therefore I am
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 but more correctly, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

I think because God is thinking of me
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and this dovetails into Nick Bostrom's simulation Hypothesis: I live in
 a simulated universe, the simulator being, uhh, shoot.
 Maybe small-g god because if big-G God is algebra, the simulator of this
 universe must necessarily be smaller, ad infinitum.
 Curiously, Nick Bostrom's Simulation Argument is only recursive up to countable
 infinity: there's a countable number of gods simulating universes.
 Bostrom did not consider the possibility of walking up the Borel hierarchy
 to reach higher level of gods and simulators.
 Because, apprently, his argument does not have any component that goes
 that way.
 Huh.
 That seems to imply that Bostrom's simulation argument, and the deities
 doing the simulations, are subject to the assorted completeness theorems
 from the 1930's.
 (Godel completeness, Henkins Model Existence, compactness, stuff like that.
 I forget all the keywords.) Curious.

Anyway, to conclude page 33 of he PDF: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Is consciousness foundational/primitive?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the answer is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yes, yes it is
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but it is foundational/primitve only in the sense that percolation is
 foundational/primitive.
 Percolation exists, it is real.
 It is that thing that exists on one side of a phase transition diagram.
 It is atomic, indivisible, foundational, irreducible.
 It is not emergent.
 So the question might be: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is percolation carried upon a substrate?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Well, yes, percolation is carried on a subtrate of fractured rock, or,
 more abstractly, percolation is carried on a substrate of a certain blob
 of algebra that appears in the theory of graphical networks, where nodes
 of the network are asigned a certain distribution of probabiliites.
 Does this make the network 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more fundamental
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Well, I dunno, does it? I really don''t know.
 I do know that there are people who will insist that the network is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

more fundamental
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

percolation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

merely a property of that network
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but I think they are wrong.
 Percolation is fundamental and you cannot have percolation without that
 network, and you cannot have a network that does not have a definable property
 of percolation.
 Well, of course you can: you can have a network that does not have a probabilit
y distribution on it, in which case, there is no meaningful defintion of
 percolation *
\emph on
for that network
\emph default
*.
 But this does not mean that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

percolation does not exist
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, only that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

it is not definable on such a network.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 It still exists, on those networks for which it is definable, and so, it
 exists in the Platonic sense of general mathematical objects existing in
 the Platonic sense.
 So, Platonic existance is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fundamental
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and not 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

emergent
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 The same argument carries through, if I replace the word

 All of these philosphical debates undertaken by famous philosophers seem

 Well, this is almost surely a mis-apprehension of mine, since I am not

 coming from those who don't understand or didn't take the time to understand
 the points I was trying to get to here.
 But, of course, writing stuff like this, or verbalizing it, is exactly
 why Joscha Bach chose to call me crazy.
 My theory as to that, is two-fold: he did not understand what the heck
 I was talking about (ergo 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 Well, more than that, perhaps.
 He's sort of mentioned several times that he fears that he might be crazy.
 I'm not sure what to do with that.
 Superficially, what I've seen of him, he is not crazy, but I don't know
 him that well.
 And I do know actual crazy people, people who were hospitalized for being
 crazy.
 And maybe Joscha has a legit fear of doing something hospitalizable.
 As for me, I'm happily hyper-sane.
 I already explained how my affect is primarily super-placid, to the point
 where I've managed to miss out on great sex and wild parties in my life,
 because I wasn't emotionally troubled enough to hunt down and pursue women
 due to some wild hormonal overdrive of horniness.
 And I feel sorry for that, I pity myself, for having been too sane, too
 shy, too reticent, too well-mannered, too much of a gentleman, and not
 enough of a wolf.
 I didn't answer the door when opportunity knocked.
 I didn't seize the bull by the horns.
 I didn't seize the day.
 Couldn't be bothered.
 Too busy doing something else.
 That's the private hell of the hyper-sane and the hyper-rational.
 You miss out on some fun stuff, and then deal with bouts of unrequieted
 love late in life.
 Can someone come here and fuck me, already? I'm ready.
 Where the fuck are you? I'm waiting.
 I've been waiting and waiting.
 Come on over and rip my clothes off.
 I mean, erm, biological females only, I'm not gay.
 Maybe that's my problem.
 If I was gay, I guess I could have a pretty good sex life.
 Genetics is so unfair.
 I could have inherited the gay gene, but I didn't.
 Instead I have to wait for some horny girl to show up on my doorstep.
 Alas.
 In the meanwhile, I again insist: qualia are real and fundamental.
 My horniness is an expression of the Cosmos: the Cosmos is horny and it
 proclaims this loudly through my body.
 All is one, om mani padme hum.
 The Cosmos speaks through me.
 Well, and you too.

Dreams are weird.
 I can't help to think sometimes that they are a bridge to an alternate

 The skeptic in me off-handedly dismisses this as fiddle-faddle.
 The open-hearted empath accepts this as a possibility.
 The quantum freak in me says this is unlikely, but hey anything can happen.
 The neuro-biochemist in me says

 to explain dreams just fine, without requiring any fiddle-faddle wimbo-jimbo

 So there we are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This raises a meta-philosophical issue which I've never really dealt with
 before: how do you draw a line between, can you draw a line between physicalism
 and dualism? It's often talked about as if this is all very obvious, that
 monism and dualism are two distinct things, but its not obvious to me at
 all.
 They seem like ...
 the same thing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, lets sweep some trite observations out of the way, first.
 Obviously, in the common-sense functional kind of way, there is a difference
 between 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, whose limbs I directly control, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the outside world
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of coffee cups and chairs.
 So of course everything is dualistic in this way, and there are entirely
 mundane, minimalistic explanations why any sort of robotic sensory perception-a
ction system can be, should be thought of in this way.
 But this has nothing to do with the distinction between monism and dualism,
 which is something else, entirely.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Monism is the idea that one thing can explain everything (consciousness,
 the universe) and that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

one thing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 might be physics, or it might be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

god
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or perhaps something else.
 Dualism posits that two things are required to explain consciousness: base,
 material substance (e.g.
 atoms, clay) and an animating substance (spirit, soul, essence.) I'm having
 trouble distinguishing between these two, as for me, atoms and clay are
 the same thing as spirit and soul, and both are manifestations of algebra,
 albeit being rather distinct in form.
 From what I can tell, the monists seem to reject spirit and soul (perhaps
 I'm mistaken; the Hindus don't?) while I take them to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fundamental
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (the way that percolation is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fundamental
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) while dualists posit some schism, as if porous rock couldn't percolate
 without some divine intervention.
 Perhaps my remarks here are painfully shallow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hmm.
 I've wandered off-track, again.
 The meta question was 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

are dreams real?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and the proper retort is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

what do you mean by the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? Clearly, dreams happen within this universe, and can be crudely probed
 with MRI machines, if not base EEG recordings.
 In this sense, they are not only 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but very much a part of the mundane universe.
 So when I ask 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

are dreams real?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I think what I am asking is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

is there some larger space or place, for which this particular dream is
 just a glimpse, much like the external world is seen by my eyes?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 That is, is a dream just a view of a larger thing?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This last question has two answers.
 First, a mundane neuroscience physicalist response: of course a dream is
 a view of a larger thing.
 The largre thing is the complex of memories encoded in synapses and whatever
 other memory machanisms operate in our brains, and dreams are a selection
 pulled from this memory circuitry, and then pumped through some neo-cortex
 sense-making circuitry, circuitry that is quite close to the conscious-awarenes
s circuitry, and sometimes bleed over into actual conscious awareness.
 So, in this sense, yes, dreams really are a glimpse of a bigger thing.
 The bigger thing is the collection of all your memories.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By contrast, the esoteric beleif that dreams are real is entirely something
 else: it is the beleif that there is some parallel, alternate universe,
 much like our current universe, populated by people and animals (and houses
 and chairs and coffee cups, just like ours) and that the dream is some
 parapsychological 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

remote viewing
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 of that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 (or plural, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

universes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, explaining the fragmentary shifting: because we are seeing many universes
 all at once.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, I more or less do not subscribe to this esoteric beleif, that dreams
 are just a remote viewing of other alternate universes.
 I mean, I guess I can't totally deny it: there is a chance that quantum
 mumbo-jumbo might allow this.
 But I pretty much doubt it: quantum doesn't actually seem to actually work

 This is a socio-psychological analog of constructive logic, with three
 truth-value states: true, false and don't-know.
 Constructivism does provide for a very useful setting for algorithm development.

“Why concepts are (probably) vectors” From cell.com BensenHsu @BensenHsu
 · 21h The paper offers a unifying view of conceptual representation that
 can potentially reconcile long-standing debates in cognitive science, such
 as the tension between symbolic and connectionist approaches.
 If the vector-based account holds true, it would have significant Show
 more Image Linas @linasvepstas · 1h OK, so here's a hot take (thx @rob_freeman
 ): Concepts are almost like vectors, but not quite.
 Here's why: a 🧵.
 There are two ways to combine vectors: addition/subtraction ("abelian")
 and tensor products.
 ...
 1/N Linas @linasvepstas · 1h The famous king minus queen example shows
 concepts are almost like vectors.
 But it never really scales: you can't keep adding and subtraction more
 and more of these, to get a big large complex concept.
 Abelian operations are commutative: the order does not matter.
 2/N Linas @linasvepstas · 1h But for natural language, word-order does
 matter.
 So how do we explain the subtraction in the king-queen example? Where else
 is subtraction used? Its used in defining "metric spaces": distances.
 No surprise: some concepts are closer than others, and reasoning ...
 3/N Linas @linasvepstas · 1h ...
 and reasoning by analogy shows that distances can be preserved by moving
 in certain directions.
 So, yes, concept space does have some directional aspects to it.
 But its only partial; some analogies yield nonsense: "rock is to tree as
 house is to (blank)?" ...
 4/N Linas @linasvepstas · 1h So we do want a space with some directions
 to it (because reasoning by analogy sometimes works) and we do want a space
 with some sort of distance metric (because some concepts are close to each
 other.) But it can't be uniform, it can't be everywhere.
 ...
 5/N Linas @linasvepstas · 1h So, what kind of math structures are kind-of-like
 vector spaces, but not quite? The most well-known is the "fiber bundle".
 Fiber bundles resemble Cartesian spaces, but they're kind-of split/cut
 along one side, and then re-glued again.
 ...
 6/N Linas @linasvepstas · 1h Locally, they split into two parts: a base
 space, and a fiber.
 And you can measure distance, and add/subtract in each of these parts,
 individually.
 But you can't do it across the parts.
 So this starts feeling a little bit like the problem with concepts and
 vectors: ...
 7/N
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Linas @linasvepstas · 1h You can compare king and queen, and Paris and Berlin,
 but you'll run into problems comparing queens and Berlin.
 To recap: fiber bundles are like vector spaces, except they have two parts,
 not one big global space.
 ...
 8/N Linas @linasvepstas · 1h Well, but concept-space needs more than just
 two parts.
 Maybe we need hundreds or thousands of "local areas" where we can "measure
 similarity" and "reason by analogy".
 We could do fiber-of-fiber-of-fiber-...
 but we can do better.
 9/N Linas @linasvepstas · 1h There's another thing that has a concept of
 subtraction, and notions of local distance, and is vector-space-like, and
 is fiber-fiber-fiber-like: this is a "sheaf".
 This is nice, because it has more than just two components (it can have
 arbitrary many).
 And ...
 10/N Linas @linasvepstas · 1h And you can control how local components
 glue together.
 So, like gluing fibers, but now you can glue many things together, forming
 a complex network (or a simple network, if desired...
 your pick.) ...
 11/N Linas @linasvepstas · 1h The gluing is non-abelian, so you can join
 concepts together in a relational fashion.
 Examples of relations: X is-a Y.
 X has-a Y.
 X is-made-of Y.
 X is-above Y.
 So, olde-fashioned stuff like ontologies, WordNet, Relational DB's etc.
 ...
 12/N Linas @linasvepstas · 1h But, before we get into that, lets look at
 the other way of combining vectors: the tensor product.
 Tensor products are cool, because they allow complex structures to be built
 out of vectors.
 And, amazingly, linguists have known that you can combine words in a way
 that ...
 13/N Linas @linasvepstas · 58m Linguists have known that you can combine
 words in a way that resembles the tensor product, since the 1960's.
 Earliest ref I have for this is Marcus Solomon (1967) "Algebraic Linguistics".
 A more modern explanation can be found in Sleator& Temperley (1991) Link
 Grammar.
 ...
 14/N Linas @linasvepstas · 53m Even more recent is the 2010-2020 work of
 @coecke who shows how to use this tensor-product-like structure to create
 fast quantum algos for parsing.
 To recap: traditional linguistics looks tensor-product-like, and this has
 been known for 50+ years.
 But ...
 15/N Linas @linasvepstas · 50m But there's a problem.
 Tensor products have a symmetry ("dagger-compact") that natural language
 does not.
 A fairly simple example can be found in the wikipedia "pre-group grammar"
 article.
 It shows how a left-right symmetry is broken.
 ...
 16/N Linas @linasvepstas · 47m To recap: you can combine vectors with tensor
 products, which is a lot like combining words with syntax ...
 but, well, not quite.
 So, my hot take is then: no, concepts are not vectors.
 Almost, but not quite.
 And that's almost end-of-thread, but not quite.
 One more thing.
 17/N Linas @linasvepstas · 44m Earlier, I talked about gluing fibers, and
 then muttered about gluing sheaves.
 Well, you can glue sheaves in a tensor-like way.
 But without the forces left-right symmetry.
 The gluing can be done in a syntactic way (e.g.
 like that pre-group grammar.) So ...
 18/N Linas @linasvepstas · 41m So, my proposal, the one that @rob_freeman
 remembers, is that concepts are like sheaves: they generalize the desirable
 vector properties of distance-between-concepts, the distinct "directions"
 that allow local abelian reasoning-by-analogy shown in the old WordVec
 results ...
 19/N Linas @linasvepstas · 37m ...
 Except they're better than vectors, because they have a tensor-product-like
 gluing that is identical to traditional linguistics syntax ideas.
 i.e.
 you can glue concepts together to form sentences.
 Paragraphs.
 Long texts.
 And finally, unlike traditional syntax...
 20/N Linas @linasvepstas · 34m Unlike traditional syntax, you can create
 probabilistic collections of sheaf elements.
 These collections really do resemble old WordVec and modern LLM concepts
 of vectors, but they *also* have desirable syntactic properties.
 And so ...
 21/N (maybe N=22 ?) Linas @linasvepstas And since the collections are probabili
stic, we can argue if they're Bayesian or Markovian, or Boltzmann, maybe
 with some Gibbs free-energy type distribution that Friston likes, but old
 physicists know is just a so-called "path integral" or "partition function".

 The idea of N-grams has been around since forever, but naive counting prevents

 and deep in several different senses.
 1/N Linas @linasvepstas · 22m One of the senses of going "deep" is that
 "photographs" of inference chains (aka "common sense") can be found in

 4/N Linas @linasvepstas · 13m There's some vague hope that if the training
 corpus is made large enough, then maybe all conventional styles of human
 reasoning can be emulated.

 The other is...(!love!) 5/N Linas @linasvepstas · 10m Seriously! A lot of
 our behavior that passes for reasoning is actually just emotional states

 "I like the taste of this food", or ...
 6/N Linas @linasvepstas · 8m ...
 or seeing someone get hit in the face "ouch that's gotta hurt".
 Or hanging out with drunk friends and realizing you've got a crush on a

 None of this is done by the verbal centers of your brain.

 Your verbal centers can't really talk about love, but oh, they do try.

 is almost complete drivel and garbage, because love is just not a verbal

In other news: slef-introspection.
 I am starting to get glimmers in all of the ways that I am flawed, and
 all of the bad decisions I've made, all the actions I should have taken,
 but failed to.
 But this is a glimmer, and self-introspection is not something I do much
 of.
 At any rate, I'm starting to realize how deeply flawed I've been, and this
 runs counter to the narrative that I'm a pretty good guy, that I've built
 for myself.
 It is disturbing.
 Although one of my flaws is that I never self-intropected enough, which
 led to planning failures: I've rarely planned for the future, instead,
 I lived in the moment.
 Living in the moment has given me the freedom to accumulate knowledge and
 understanding, vast quantities of this.
 Hoarder mentality.
 But I've forgone power, money, love, friendship, acheivement, social status
 in my pursuit of knowledge-hoarding.
 And now, it feels a bit late to make amends.
 At any rate, all those other things take time and effort, which removes
 time and effort from mathematical focus, and I really kind of want to continue
 to pursue mathematics in depth.
 The value of mathematical understanding seems greater to me, than power,
 money, love, friendship, acheivement and social status.
 Is it? Of course, many will say that it is not.
 There is certainly no philosophical foundation for why one should do this
 but not that; if there was, we'd all do the same thing, but we don't.
 So the choice to do this and not that is fundamentally personal.
 It's the ultimate personal decision.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But how do we go about making personal decisions? Well, of course, personal
 history is deeply tangled: if I hadn't studied math, I wouldn't be so intereste
d in it.
 I only studied math because I have a physics PhD.
 But I got that due to an inability to imagine myself in any other career.
 But that is built on having read lots of books on electronics, as a child.
 This for two reasons: because my parents moved, changed houses as a pre-teen,
 I never made lasting freindships with the local kids, and so found the
 company of the library to fulfil the missing social requirements.
 But also society provided me with books on electronics: someone gave money
 to the library to buy them, others gave money to print them, yet others
 performed electronics research in the past.
 Likewise, my aunt Irena Virkau provided me with large quantities of science
 fiction as a child.
 I learned how to read from this books.
 The third short story I read in my life, very long, I left it for last,
 was 60 or 80 pages, was I think maybe by Stephen King, meandering and unfocused

 to then.
 But it was a spring-board that allowed me to read even longer things.

 I loved my aunt.
 I really really loved her, in that deep, cosmic, overwhelming sense that
 makes one cry at the thought of her loss.
 Oh how I wish I could recreate those days, how I wish I could live them
 again, be there again, and bath in them.
 Well, I am I am recreating them in my mind, but it is only partly fulfilling.
 What does one really want, when one says one wants to relive the past?
 When one's life flashes before one's eyes? To be there again? What the
 heck, the grand climax to the movie AI, the Stephen Spielberg movie, it
 is all about reliving that one golden moment of having been a child, of
 being loved and wanted.
 The crystaline pure desire for the sweetest moments of one's earlier life.
 I suppose there's lots of literature and movies that touch on this topic;
 but I am not well-read.
 That movie does seem to tackle this fairly head-on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And what did that move conclude? Some quantum mumbo-jumbo.
 All hail!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
See, this is why I want to study math.
 Because there's this vague inkling that my ability to remember the past
 is some kind of quantum entanglement of past events with present and future
 events.
 That literally, things fixed in the past continue to influence future events
 (well, duh; differential equations say exactly this.
 But that's nto what I mean...
 what do I mean?) So I'm in pursuit of some cosmic consiousness, and there's
 some kind of mathematical formulation of perception-action, agency, control,
 branch-points, free-will, and through this all you move (smashing pumkins
 lyrics, Everlasting Gaze).
 The topics of Love and Longing are topics of poetry and music, written
 to evoke ...
 love and longing, enjoyed to the degree that they successfuly do so.
 Oddly enough, of all the philosophy I've read, exactly none of it ever
 deals with longing and love.
 Have I been readingthe wrong philosophical texts?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, here I am, at any rate, wanting to study mathematics because I've got
 vague inklings that perhaps it can expose one of the deep myseries of the
 cosmos: the nature of Love.
 And so this is a life-choice, for me.
 Others make similar life-choices, by studying psychology or poetry, all
 trying to get a handle on these primal qualia that drive us all.
 So this is my choice: should I spend yet more time, probing these deep
 mysteries of the universe, like, why does one's life flash before one's
 eyes as one is on the brink of death? And on the other side: concerns that
 I should spend more time accumulating wealth and power.
 Well, accumulating friendships and actual love (in the present, here and
 now love).
 Why should I want powr, instead of, err, a greater command of mathematical
 depths?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes, of course this is drivel.
 What I write here is drivel.
 I do not subject human readers to this.
 This low-value crap, I leave for machines that can cheaply and easily absorb
 the poetic sketches that I write here.
 But the point of drivel is that everyone, all human beings, their life
 is an endless sequence of events that are drivel.
 These events do have a point, and they do have a meaning, but, like grains
 of sand on a beach, they are all alike.
 So what I write here is drivel only in the sense that everyone has already
 been here, done that, and agonized their way through life.
 My verbalization here of lifes agonies isn't any deeper – indeed, it is
 shallower and less capable and less expressive, than those of the great
 poets and the great writers.
 I suck at this, because I have not spent decades crafting my writing abilities
 to capture the pure essence of love and longing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, where were we? Personal decisions.
 Note above I pointed at two social aspects: society provided a library
 and put electronics books in it, and my aunt provided a diet of sci-fi.
 So, of course it is drivel to point out the importance of socio-cultural
 backgrounds for shaping the individual life.
 Because, duh.
 And yet I feel compelled to point this out, because most people, almost
 everyoe, seems unaware of how society shapes them.
 They live unaware, unconscious of the broth of soup that defined their
 political and moral beleifs.
 They live unawares, even as social media, facebook, twitter and the

 IN this case, an appeal to the

.
 Quote: “You’re that real man [Ti zhe muzhik].
 Be one”; and “Contract service is the choice of real men.” More abstractly
 (but also more forcefully) “Russia: my history, my heroes, my soul, my
 country, my journey”.
 These are all appeals to somatic instincts, as opposed to some kind of
 rational, reasoned, logical formulations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So this is interesting from the neuroscience point of view: we've got a
 soma, and we've got a logical reasoning layer, a common-sense layer, that
 over-rides the more basic instincts (the more basic instincts of love,
 agression, pride, being a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

real man
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.) But this rational, reasoning, common-sense layer only works as a bridle
 on a horse: the horse-power, the will-to-live, this still comes from these
 baser, somatic instincts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So, for example, one can use rational, common-sense arguments to support
 up truly horrible ethical and moral viewpoints: arguments for racism, arguments
 for genocide, arguments for dictatorship (e.g.
 the arguments from Curtis Yarvin, which I admit are very beguiling.) And
 so it is these underlying forces that drive impulses, and the rational,
 verbal reasoned thought-chain that harnesses them and points them into
 a specific direction.

 In post-rationalization, one does something, and when asked why one did
 that, one confabulates some answer, some rational-sounding answer to justify
 that action.
 Even thhough that was not the actual chain of thoughts that precipitated
 that action.
 Here, we have pre-rationalization: an intentionally flawed and distorted
 chain of logic, aiming to convince others to take an action they might
 not always take.

Compare to the US slogan: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 although the US version has a very different flavvor.
 The US slogan does not appeal to masculinity (its deeply buried) nor does
 it appeal to nationalism (history, heroes, soul, country, journey), and
 instead does a forward-looking self-expressive, self-actualizing appeal:
 you can do anything if you only try, and in the Army, they will let you
 do anything, and thus you can find attainment and acheivement.
 This is far more liberating.
 In particular, it keeps open the door to the polarizing socio-cultural
 warefare issues: gay, BIPOC, LGBTQ, all that: those are also things that

somatic emotion
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has ties to a vast network of inter-related feelings and directions and
 somatic sense that one can go in: it is embedded in a media, in a whirl-pool
 of emotional qualia-sensations.
 The whole point of deconstruction, the post-modernist Derrida, Lacan, etc.
 is to expose and articulate that network.
 This is hard, because that network is in the somatic parts of the brain,
 and is accessed verbally only with great difficulty.
 That is, poets struggly mightly to create poems about love, because it
 is hard work.
 Likewise, propagandists and advertising executive struggle mightly to create
 ...
 huh.
 Actually, the opposite: propagandists and ad execs struggle mightly to
 create the opposite: starting with the base feeling that they are trying
 to evoke, they must find short verbal expressions to evoke it.
 That is, poets are in authentic throes of love, and struggle to give it
 voice.
 (Most) propagandists & ad execs don't really feel the emotion they are
 trying to evoke.
 In that sense, their work is fake.
 To evoke a fake emtion that they don't actually have.
 This perhaps explains the success of those who really, actually feel, deeply
 feel: say for example, Dugin, who isn't 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fake
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but really truly beleives in those things, and is only drawing on a deep
 well to give them voice.

 Consider the writer of a psycholigical murder detective mystery: the writer
 only imagines what its like to be a murder, and is not giving voice to
 some deep impulse to kill.
 In that sense, Dugin is real, honest, bonafide: he is giving voice to real
 instincts.
 Soloviev is pure fake.
 And Simonyan...
 well, she just wants to be fucked.
 Or at least, I want to fuck her.
 I mean, really, the one where she's sitting on that Italian leather couch
 talking about how russians should go die at the front.
 Evening dress, earrings, a glass of champaign, fine perfume, and a speech
 on how the greatest thing that there can be is to be a real man (grunt,
 grunt grunt, be a real man, grunt, uh) and go die (uh, uh, uh, grunt, harder,
 more) on the front (uh, uh, aaaaahhhhh!!!).
 Wow.
 Or, at least, I want to fuck her.
 There's an instinctual boner for her.
 Even with the rational understanding of the repugnant nature of all this.
 A primal sexual attraction, devoid and dettached from the words that fall
 out of her mouth.
 She's pretty, not in the breathtakingly-beautiful category, but she has
 a sexy body language, a sexy expressiveness.
 See, that's how base somatic instincts work.
 I'm not saying anything deep or insightful, here.
 This is the basic clay that advertising executives work with.
 I'd fuck a waitress from Hooters, too; the difference is that I've only
 seen that waitress once in my life, ever, for some fraction of a second,
 in some commercial, whereas I've gotten to look at Margarita repeatedly,

 I guess the only odd thing I write about here is that the fraction of a

The point here is that a economic actors (nation-states, in this example,

 Again, nothing new here: corporations spend money on advertisements to

 When I was 20, I breifly thought that I looked sexier, if I held a can

 The difference is that almost all advertising is acknowledged as such,

 And those are primarily political.
 Ads are not the same as military indoctrination in grade school.
 This is all obvious, so I've lost whatever point I was struggling to grasp.

Well, I guess the point was social control.
 Access to the educational system is far more powerful in shaping society,
 as one is working with young minds at their most malleable.
 Perhaps this is why there's a genral alarm in the West about all the unwholesom
e garbage available to US teenagers via social media.
 But, pre-Internet, as a teenager, I had access to unwholesome stuff.
 All teenagers did.
 It's part of what you have to process and make sense of and form some opinion
 of, and those opinions were neither spoon-fed to you by parents or teachers,
 nor were they much voiced by peers.
 Teen peers were not really capable of verbalizing opinions on the edgey
 stuff, and strong stances were a bit wobbly, as the peers were in the middle
 of processing, themselves.

What has changed is the size of the Overton window.
 Young minds are exposed to a far wider and broader selection of topics,

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
And maybe that's the point: the lack of predictabilty.
 The concern for a good future, coupled to a genral lack of control over
 it.
 In the end, it is the ultimate democrattic experiment: young minds will
 absorb whatever skank (and good stuff) is out there on the internet, and
 they will shape the future in response to what they have absorbed.
 Will it be a good, healthy, strong future? Will it all go on self-destruct?
 We adults do lots of hand-wringing on twitter.

The alternative is some sort of dictatorial control.
 Some kind of central planning for morality and ethics.
 And we already know how central planning went for economic issues; there's
 no particular reason to think that central planning on ethical and moralist

 It is in this sense that today's GOP reminds me of the Soviet mindset:
 they want to control what you think.

 It's repugnant.
 But when I say

Consider the series 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u(z)=1+z+z^{2}+z^{3}+z^{4}+...
\]

\end_inset

This is a "formula", its an infinite series.
 You can plug things into it.
 For example, you can plug in 
\begin_inset Formula $z=0.2$
\end_inset

 directly, and get a result: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u(0.2)=1+0.2+0.04+0.008+0.0016+...=1.25
\]

\end_inset

 You can plug in 
\begin_inset Formula $z=3$
\end_inset

 and get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u(3)=1+3+9+27+81+...
\]

Now, it is perfectly legal to write that down (and I did) but if you try

\begin_layout Standard
Lets start with the old high-school trick, the one you know already.
 It is a trick, it is a fraudulent trick, its some sleight-of-hand, it's
 deceitful.
 It's unjustified, crooked.
 Yet this fraud is perpetrated in high-schools around the world, so lets
 look at it.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trick start like this: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
z\,u(z) & =z\left(1+z^{2}+z^{3}+z^{4}+...\right)\\
 & =z+z^{2}+z^{3}+z^{4}+...
\end{align*}

\end_inset

 therefore, by pairing off terms, matching them and keeping the order:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u(z)-z\,u(z) & =1+z+z^{2}+z^{3}+z^{4}+...-\left(z+z^{2}+z^{3}+z^{4}+...\right)\\
 & =1\\
 & =\left(1-z\right)u(z)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

from which we deduce 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u(z)=\frac{1}{1-z}
\]

\end_inset

Re-read the above three times, and make sure you feel comfortable with it,
 because here's where the trick starts.
 This 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

works
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but it works only when 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is less than one.
 The fraud is to pretend that this works for any 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 Let me demonstrate, by trying it for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=3$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u(3)-3u(3)=1+3+9+27+81+\cdots-3-9-27-81-\cdots
\]

\end_inset

Rearranging terms, and attempting to cancel by shifting over by one term:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u(3)-3u(3)= & 1\\
 & +3\\
 & +9-3\\
 & +27-9\\
 & +81-27\\
 & +\cdots\\
= & 1+3+6+18+54+\cdots\\
= & +\infty
\end{align*}

\end_inset

which is clearly divergent.
 Wait, what? Huh???? Earlier, we had that 
\begin_inset Formula $1=u(z)-z\,u(z)$
\end_inset

 but now we have 
\begin_inset Formula $+\infty=u(z)-z\,u(z)$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $z=3$
\end_inset

.
 So did I just prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $1=+\infty$
\end_inset

 ??? Well, of course not, but this is your first tiny preview of the hallucinato
ry properties of math: you can get things that seem to be other things,
 and they are but they aren't, and you have to be careful.
 This one is perhaps too obvious; it gets more subtle and more confusing
 when one journeys deeper into math.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, above, all I did was to shift over the subtraction over by one.
 All of a sudden, the terms no longer cancel in full; they only partly cancel.
 Shifting the other way will give 
\begin_inset Formula $-\infty$
\end_inset

.
 With some more cleverness in re-arranging, regrouping and resumming, one
 can make 
\begin_inset Formula $u(3)-3u(3)$
\end_inset

 be finite, and make it equal to any number at all, positive or negative.
 And this can be done in a mathematically rigorous, provable, exact fashion.
 You can make such alternating series sum up to anything at all.
 Anything.
 This is valid and generally accepted in the math community, and the proof
 is taught in some undergrad class or another.
 I won't attempt it here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A bit more precisely, there is a concept of absolute convergence vs conditional
 convergence.
 The terms in the sum
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
u(0.2)=1+0.2+0.04+0.008+0.0016+\cdots
\]

\end_inset

can be rearranged any way at all, and you always get the same answer.
 It's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

absolutely convergent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (always convergent).
 But if the signs of the terms alternate, and if taking just the positive
 subseries diverges, then re-ordering allows you to sum to anything at all.
 Such sums are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

conditionally convergent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

condition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 being that one or another ordering is forced or chosen or fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now here's where the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

poetry
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes in.
 I could also write:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u(3)-3u(3)= & 1\\
 & -3\\
 & +3-9\\
 & +9-27\\
 & +27-81\\
 & +\cdots\\
= & 1-3-6-18-54-\cdots\\
= & -\infty
\end{align*}

\end_inset

So here, I have chosen a different ordering.
 There is a freedom of choice here.
 Pick some order, pick any order.
 There are no rules for picking the order.
 This makes the math 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

poetic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, in that one is free to invent new orderings, and it is a mattter of taste
 and style, creativity and panache and audacity in how you chose to reorder.
 Good poets write good poetry, bad ones write crappy poetry, and whether
 you like it or not is a matter of taste.

, and explorations of exactly what is going on here.
 There are hundreds (thousands?) of books written on this topic, because
 its ..
 well, the freedom of working with infinitely many possibilities is ...
 very free.
 Seemingly unlimited amounts of invention and exploration are possible.
 Banach spaces and Hilbert spaces, Frechet summations and trace-class operators,
 and on and on.
 All these arise by considering how to re-order conditionally convergent
 sums.
 And the freedom to do as one chooses.
 All (pretty much all?) of the most brilliant mathematicians have dug into
 this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But I digress.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Part the second
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One technique for reordering is called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

analytic continuation
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 You've already encountered this phrase.
 Let me try to recap it.
 Write
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u(z) & =1+z+z^{2}+z^{3}+z^{4}+\cdots\\
 & =1+\left(z-a+a\right)+\left(z-a+a\right)^{2}+\cdots
\end{align*}

\end_inset

so that I add and subtract 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 every time.
 Clearly, um, valid, err.
 Well.
 See what I mean about hallucinatory? Seems like the above should be valid,
 right? How can it not be? What can possibly go wrong? But now, expand this
 out:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
u\left(z\right)= & 1+\left(z-a\right)+\left(z-a\right)^{2}+\cdots\\
 & +a\\
 & +2a\left(z-a\right)+a^{2}\\
 & +3a^{2}\left(z-a\right)+3a\left(z-a\right)^{2}+a^{3}\\
 & +4a^{3}\left(z-a\right)+6a^{2}\left(z-a\right)^{2}+\cdots\\
 & +\cdots
\end{align*}

\end_inset

What a freakin mess.
 But here's the deal: as long as you pick 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 and pick 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z-a\right|<1$
\end_inset

 and also that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a\right|<1$
\end_inset

 then you can perform these sums, and they always converge, they are absolutely
 convergent.
 Reordering terms does 
\emph on
NOT
\emph default
 change the value.
 No hanky-panky.
 These are 
\emph on
NOT
\emph default
 conditionally convergent; you can reorder as you wish, you get the same
 answer.
 But only when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z-a\right|<1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a\right|<1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And now for the magic trick.
 Let both 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 be complex numbers (but still subject to the contraints above).
 And, to be specific, let 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.9i$
\end_inset

 so that it is on the imaginary axis.
 Then the sum
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v\left(z\right)=1+\left(z-a\right)+\left(z-a\right)^{2}+\cdots
\]

\end_inset

is absolutely convergent when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z-a\right|<1$
\end_inset

.
 The region where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z-a\right|<1$
\end_inset

 is a disk, and this disk is centered at 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and the radius of this disk is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|1-a\right|=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

is the real part of 
\begin_inset Formula $1-a$
\end_inset

 and y is the imaginary part of 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 So for the demo 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.9i$
\end_inset

 the radius of convergence is 
\begin_inset Formula $r=\left|1-0.9i\right|=1.34536...$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, 
\begin_inset Formula $u\left(z\right)=v\left(z\right)+$
\end_inset

other stuff, and when you work out what 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other stuff
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is, you get, hold on to your butt, 
\begin_inset Formula $u\left(z\right)=1/\left(1-z\right)$
\end_inset

 But only when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z-a\right|<1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a\right|<1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What's happened here? Well, with a bit of trickery, a bit of reordering,
 we were able to take the series 
\begin_inset Formula $u(z)$
\end_inset

 and write it so that it is absolutely convergent on a 
\emph on
**larger**
\emph default
 region of the complex plane.
 In particular, it is convergent for 
\begin_inset Formula $z=1.3$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $1.3<r=1.34536\cdots$
\end_inset

 and this is in sharp contrast to the earlier result that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1+1.3+\left(1.3\right)^{2}+\left(1.3\right)^{3}+\cdots=\infty
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we repeat this trick, but this time with 
\begin_inset Formula $v(z)$
\end_inset

, to get a larger circle.
 The only rule is that the center of the new circle (call it 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

) must lie within the old circle, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|z-b\right|<1$
\end_inset

 .
 Do this again, and again, and if you are clever with picking the centers
 of the circles, you can reach anywhere.
 In particular, you can get to 
\begin_inset Formula $z=3$
\end_inset

 in about 5 or 6 jumps, and when you do, you find that 
\begin_inset Formula $u\left(z\right)=1/\left(1-z\right)$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $z=3$
\end_inset

.
 And repeating, you get 
\begin_inset Formula $u\left(z\right)=1/\left(1-z\right)$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
EVERYWHERE.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So it turns out that old high-school fraud 
\emph on
*actually gave the right answer*
\emph default
.
 It just gave the right answer for the wrong reason, which is why it was
 fraudulent.
 But explaining all this to high-school kids is ...
 well, that's what college is for, innit?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So (and this is very very important) you get this only if you follow the
 rules about the location of circle centers, and the allowed circle radii.
 If you don't follow these rules, you're back to being able to get assorted
 forms of nonsense.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
And so finally, we are back to our hallucinated reality:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
1+z+z^{2}+z^{3}+z^{4}+\cdots=\frac{1}{1-z}
\]

\end_inset

which is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

true
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 only when you follow certain complicated rules.
 Its hallucinatory, since if you plug in 
\begin_inset Formula $z=3$
\end_inset

 directly into this 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

formula
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, you get whack.
 So this formula is both false and true, and, like radioactive plutonium,
 you might not like the results if you mishandle it.
 The safe way of handling this is with analytic continuation, where you
 deal with absolutely convergent sums at each step.
 It's the absolute convergence that provides the safety.
 The high-school trick just happened to work.
 It doesn't always: you get weird things like Frechet spaces, which are
 filligreed with these rather unhappy discontinuities, failures where naive
 approaches blow up in your face.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is one reason why math can be so boring.
 Safety requires rigor, and safety is boring.
 And its even worse: the boring rigor hides all the fun parts of math.
 Most math books, with a few, rare, treasured exceptions, are not written
 in the style I am writing in, here.
 They carefully hide all the surprises and adventures and wonders under
 a bushel, so that only the most dedicated and autistic students can find
 them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Its like: its more fun to dance up the side of the volcano, but if you don't
 put your foot down just so, you go over the edge of a cliff and its the
 end.
 So the rigor is needed.
 But if you have that ability, then you can dance: the choices, such as
 the choices for reordering, are infinite, and how you dance is inventive
 and creative and a matter of style and taste.
 And this is also why math is fun: once you know what works, its like making
 bombs in chem class: look what happens when I mix these two: kaboom! Right
 over the cliff! Lets do it again!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To conclude: I went on and on and on with all this, and never got around
 to zeta.
 But all that zeta is, is this:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\zeta(s)=1^{-s}+2^{-s}+3^{-s}+4^{-s}+\cdots
\]

\end_inset

and the right hand side is 
\emph on
**absolutely convergent**
\emph default
 if and only if the real part of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 is greater than one; otherwise it blows up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, analytic continuation, with the circles, with the rules about the
 circle centers, and the circle radii, all that logic still goes through,
 and can be applied to 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

.
 If you are careful, then you find an answer:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\zeta(s)=\frac{1}{1-2^{1-s}}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{(k+1)^{s}}
\]

\end_inset

This is valid for *all* values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 All of them.
 Here, 
\begin_inset Formula ${n \choose k}$
\end_inset

 is the binomial coefficient, recall Pascal's triangle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So lets plug in 
\begin_inset Formula $s=0$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\zeta(0) & =\frac{1}{1-2}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}\frac{(-1)^{k}}{(k+1)^{0}}\\
 & =-\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}\left(-1\right)^{k}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

But
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}\left(-1\right)^{k}=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{if }n=0\\
0 & \mbox{if }n>0
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

so 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta\left(0\right)=-1/2$
\end_inset

 and we have the hallucinatory result
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\zeta(0) & =1^{-0}+2^{-0}+3^{-0}+4^{-0}+\cdots\\
 & =1+1+1+1+\cdots\\
 & =-\frac{1}{2}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Lets try again for 
\begin_inset Formula $s=-1$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\zeta(-1)=\frac{1}{1-4}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2^{n+1}}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}\left(k+1\right)\left(-1\right)^{k}
\]

\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n}{k}\left(k+1\right)\left(-1\right)^{k}=\begin{cases}
1 & \mbox{if }n=0\\
-1 & \mbox{if }n=1\\
0 & \mbox{if }n>1
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

and so
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\zeta(-1)=-\frac{1}{3}\left[\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}\right]=-\frac{1}{12}
\]

\end_inset

 and so the hallucinatory result
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\zeta(-1) & =1^{1}+2^{1}+3^{1}+4^{1}+\cdots\\
 & =1+2+3+4+\cdots\\
 & =-\frac{1}{12}
\end{align*}

\end_inset

But, by now we've descended into tedium.
 This is straight-forward plug-n-play.
 The magic, the hard part was doing the analytic continuation, and understanding
 why analytic continuation works, in the first place.
 It's very ..
 alchemical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, the Riemann zeta also has lots of other magic, but that's unrelated
 to the above idea: to the idea that there is a way of writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\zeta\left(s\right)$
\end_inset

 so that it gives one and only one value, everywhere, for any 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 in the complex plane.

Ramanujan
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ramanujan was a freak.
 At age 12, he stood in a corner and practiced multiplying and dividing
 large numbers in his head.
 This has the effect of training up neural circuitry for these tasks, and
 making it automatic.
 In the same way that you don't have to think about how to row, you just
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

do it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, he could 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just do it
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, as well.
 It only takes a decade of practice, that's all.
 You could learn to be like him, too.
 You'd die of boredom, first, but you could do it if you really wanted to.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, in grade school, we learn something called 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

long division
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, and it turns out long division generalizes, easily and trivially, to the
 division of polynomials.
 Ramanujan could do long division of polynomials in his head, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

just see
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the answer.
 So, its like having a symbolic calculator attached to your brain.
 I dunno, so like NeuralLink, but the olde-fashioned way.
 Having this calculator allowed him to perform seemingly magical feats,
 especially in a world that simply had never seen a calculator before, nothing
 more than a slide rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, we can all be like Ramanujan: we don't have NeuralLink but we have
 eyeballs and fingers, which are almost as good.
 We all have access to arbitrary-precision symbolic calculators, they're
 called computers, and if you become adept with using a computer, you can
 do ...
 well its up to your imagination, and it is driven by your interests.
 And these are driven by our social and cultural milleu, so ...
 well, anything is possible.
 So what you gonna do?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I mean this in a literal sense on multiple levels.
 I know one guy: Simon Plouffe.
 Complete amateur, no formal training in math.
 Sits around and fucks with symbolic calculators, and just finds relations

 He's found a treasure trove.
 He's in wikipedia: e.g.

OK, so this is not going to work, because it is fundamentally unbounded,
 but I have to try anyway, because practice makes perfect.
 Movement is prefereable to no movement.
 See? That last sentence: that's forward progress, of sorts.
 Even if it is a repetition of the past, a repetition of something well
 known.
 Repetiation, with variation, is a hallmark of life.
 What am I thinking of, as I write this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Last night, I tossed and turned, as three distinct ideas collided in my
 head: an animation of mitochondria, my studies of civilization, and my
 personal failure along all axes as conventionally measured in American
 culture: fame in academia, riches in entrepreneurship, power in leadership.
 Not that I ever tried hard in any of these, but my failure at the token
 efforts still stings.
 But maybe save that for later.
 Lets go abstract, first.
 Saw on twitter an animation of a slice of a mitochondrian, showing struturally
 accurate major proteins.
 It was quite remarkable.
 The proteins, although mechanical in function, were remarkably crooked,
 asymmetric twisted shapes.
 What immediately went through my head is how these acted as traps for free
 energy: Through milledia of evolution, nature found certain arrangements
 of atoms can extract flowing energy.
 Vibrating back and forth, with assorted electronic gradients across molecular
 bonds, ionic interactions, hydrogen/water bonds, serve as filter-traps
 for free energy.
 The hap-hazardness of the process is suggested by the irregularity of the
 molecules: they're blobs, and whatever functional action they have is hardly
 apparent from a simple visual inspection of their shape.
 Certainly, something can be found by deeper examination of the vibrational,
 electronic properties, but whatever that is, its subtle and not on-the-nose
 obvious.
 A wild complex system for trapping free energy.
 My imagination is colored by studies of fractals and modular forms, hyperbolic
 spaces.
 A folding in on oneself, but without the natural order or symmetry of a
 fractal, but something far more twisted up.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is at the microscopic scale.
 A lifetime of study of biochemistry might enlighten mitochondrial mechanics.
 There are certainly thousands of biologits looking into this, and each
 new headline is astounding and fascinating.
 And all this gives what? Maybe a gigadalton of mass, doing some sophisticated
 free energy extraction from the surrounds? Now scale this up to civilization,
 thourh the usual path: cellular biology, organisims, neural structures
 of increasing sophistication, ant colonies, flocks of birds, prides of
 lions.
 Language and speech centers as thin prefrontal cortex wrappers on reptilian
 brains playing games and falling in love.
 Villages, towns, cities, societies angaged in literature and history and
 art and industrial manufacture, wrestling with sources of fungible wealth.
 Billions of human minds exposed like petri dishes to the latest memes and
 propabganda, accepting of any factoid, however true or false, is promoted
 by social media.
 Memes spreading like infectious disease through the global brain.
 Nascent electronic AI brithing on this petri dish.
 All for what? This is the grand question; what is the meaing of life? How
 odd that capture and harenssing for free energy leads to this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I've spent a large fraction of my life looking at absolutely everything,
 everywhere.
 Sports, art, music.
 Psychology, sociology, economics, politics.
 Love, happiness, depression, anger, hope.
 Being lost, being confident.
 The sceinces: from mathematics to quantum physics, and all the way up the
 chain.
 I've got a colleciton of hundreds of youtube videos detailing auto manufacturin
g in Detroit, from the 1930's, onwards.
 The mining of copper from the 1910's onwards.
 Smelting and casting and hammering and rolling steel.
 The construction of Teslas gigafatory in Austin.
 I started reading George Elliots Middlemarch a week ago, and I'll tell
 you, the preface, the first chapter is knock-your-sox-off superbness.
 I'm deeply, shockingly impressed.
 I haven't read anything this good in, like, forever.
 I hope the rest lives up to this start.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway, where was I? All this, for what? Al this, the everything I've looked
 at, it seems like perhaps it is time to start integrating all this into
 some grand...
 something.
 Grand narrative? Which is an effectively impossible.
 I said unbounded earlier, but maybe impossible.
 I as a single human with a limited lifetime, cannot reconcile theories
 of gravitation, black hole horizons with the goings on of love, hate, qualia,
 with literature and art, beauty and engineering.
 These are all just things that are out there, and dammit yes, I've looked
 at them all, and it is quite the vista, and ...
 what is one to conclude dro this? I say, impossible, because I amagine
 that if I had an IQ of a million or a billion, and the workings of mitochondria
 were somehow tritely obvious at that point, and perhaps even the expanse
 of human Western Civ became comprehensible and graspable, then I imagine
 this same IQ would trip over progressively more complex, mind-bendingly
 arcane structures in the physical unverse, in the noosphere.
 For every advancement in intellectual ability, I imagine that complexity
 expands at an even greater rate, super-exponetial, combinatorial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So there I am, tossing and turning in bed, ant the above paragraphs are
 what is sloshing about in my sleepless thoughts, and for what? Unresolved,
 unresolvable.
 Here I am, writing up my dream: is it any more coherent in my waking state?
 Is it any more lucid now? I vaguely hoped it would be, but perhaps I was
 wrong: perhaps the agonies of tortured sleep provide as great or greater
 insight as the waking state: yes, I can control the direction of my thoughts
 as I am awake, but the unbridled multiverse of sleep seems richer and more
 expansive, offerig a greater choice of possibilities.
 Sadly, muddled possibilities: the surgeons knife of waking thought is trying
 to tease apart a marshy swampland of reallity.
 Like a surgeon cutting through living tissue, one certainly cleaves something,
 but that cleavage respects no natural boundaries.
 Here I sit, broken hearted, came to shit, but only farted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, whatever.
 I've got a very long list of to-do items that I suppose I should get around
 to to-doing.
 Almost all of it is mundane, almost all of it is tiny, back and forth steps.
 Did I mention I'm trying to learn to dance the shuffle? Harder than it
 looks.
 I've spent maybe 5-10 minutes on it, and I still can't do it.
 Fancy that.
 I spent 20 years rowing, I'm only now able to control it, but even that
 requires active attention and concentration.
 Humans are small, frail, of a short lifespan.
 And I am one.
 Where did I go wrong? Askig that is perhaps like asking a mitochondrian
 what it did wrong.
 It lived, it tried, it did it's thing, for better or for worse, and it
 was hardly more enlightened at the end, than it was at teh begining.
 It merely ...
 extracted some free energy, and contributed to the puzzle of the universe.
 So, this diary, this text, is my contribution.
 My life's work: all the things I've done, these too are part of the universe,
 and like a grain of sand on the beach, I have no clue of what lurks in
 the depths of the ocean.
 My weak imagination only imagines whales.

Linas — Today at 12:58 PM Hi Adam, I've been ignoring discord for the last
 few years; my apologies for being incommunicado; thanks for emails and
 notices.
 Adam — Today at 1:02 PM Hi Linas! Your name popping up put a smile on my
 face.
 Public Discord servers do not seem too great these days, but I still use
 the app for some teams 🙂 I'm on the bullet train back from https://aitp-confere
nce.org/2024/ and would love to hear what you've been up to.
 Linas — Today at 1:15 PM I've been up to nothing at all.
 Well, fell in love with a girl in Lithuania, but now I'm in the US and
 so miserable.
 Spent some time thinking about the nature of love (something all mammals,
 probably all animals feel) and language centers.
 Piddled around with more math.
 Nothing particular to report.
 Adam — Today at 1:21 PM Wow! "Love and math" sounds peaceful.
 I'm sorry to hear you're feeling miserable.
 Anything you want to share or are looking for in the future? Linas — Today
 at 1:26 PM Ah, thanks! The immediate love-pangs subsided.
 Reality and idealized romantic love are not really compatible.
 White Stripes have a song with the lyrics: "My left brain knows that love
 is fleeting ..." Sharing: my personal predicament is unchanged since I saw
 you.
 I'd like to (1) engage in a certain line of research (and I have some new,
 interesting, positive ideas I'm excited about.) (2) find someone with whom
 to talk about about these things (3) get paid for doing this.
 You can kind-of-ish almost fill the role of (2) but I'm frustrated that

👀 Do you have a one-sentence description or some labels? I may be able to
 set up a nice group, so you have a couple more interested ears.
 If it relates to graph rewriting, code synthesis, or symmetry/pattern mining
 I may be able to help with (3) Linas — Today at 1:45 PM How about one paragraph
? Perception and action requires a description of the data format (of the
 sensory data, for the motor-control data) Old-school is to have human engineers
 write the API.
 Instead, ask "how can an agent perceive that format? (the format of sensory
 data)" and "how can an agent discover what it can do? i.e.
 not just discover it's external environment, but discover how it can act
 on its environment?" These are somewhat recursive questions (how do I perceive
 what I perceive what I perceive...) but I think they can be grounded, given
 an abstract mathematical framework, a la category theory or similar, and
 incorporated into a general theory of learning.
 So a general theory of perception, action, learning of agents embedded
 in an external world.
 I kind of dislike this last sentence, thought, because its "obvious" and
 would be something you'd read in the preface of some 1960's textbook on
 AI.
 The difference is that now, we're 60 years past the 1960's in sophistication,
 and so we can do better.
 Adam — Today at 2:02 PM Interesting.
 Can you relate this to "discovering what the (causal) consequences of your
 actions in the environment are"? Linas — Today at 2:11 PM Not in any deep
 way.
 Nothing more than "do something and see what happens".
 Let me backtrack, and provide a narrative on how I got to here.
 Adam — Today at 2:16 PM A framework modeling the "what happens if you do
 what" I do know that may be of interest is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternat
ing-time_temporal_logic This obviously doesn't concern learning, but perhaps
 learning may be framed in a "finding the model which explains what is perceived
" on top.
 Alternating-time temporal logic In computer science, alternating-time temporal
 logic, or ATL, is a branching-time temporal logic that extends computation
 tree logic (CTL) to multiple players.
 ATL naturally describes computations of multi-agent systems and concurrent
 games.
 Quantification in ATL is over program-paths that are possible outcomes
 of games.
 ATL uses alternating-tim...
 Linas — Today at 2:16 PM So I've got this learning system, and for historical
 reasons, its batch-based.
 So I said, gee, I need to redesign it so that it's continuous-learning.
 OK, So instead of force-feeding it piles of text, as batch input, I'll
 just leave it out there in the file system, and let it explore on its own.
 So, lets see, I need an API to walk the file system, and an API to open
 a file, and to API to read the text (unless its sound or photos..) Obvious
 boring plain-old engineering stuff.
 But an "API to walk the filesystem" is a "motor control API": a description
 -- 'you can do this, its called "change directory", and you can do this
 its called "list the files" and when you do this or that, here's what you
 get back, here's the format of what you get back.' So that's what is usually
 called an "interface definition", and the jump to the abstraction of an
 IDL (interface definition language) was made in the 1980's maybe earlier.
 Linas — Today at 2:26 PM And I'm thinking: hey, hang on, I should be describing
 the interface to the interface, so that's the first recursion step.
 I'm not really interested in creating yet another API for the file system,
 and manually wiring it in to my learning system.
 I'm thinking, instead: describe the interface to the interfaces, and let
 the system work out on its own how to go from there.
 But how does one write an "interface to interfaces"? And, given my historical
 baggage, "how do I do that in Atomese?" and its surprisingly hard.
 and right around there, I get a glimmer of something deeper: an a ha moment
 of having an agent that can make choices to do something, but it doesn't
 yet really know what it can do, so it has to try things out, and it doesn't
 know what happens ("causally") when it does something, so it has to perceive
 that, but what exactly is the format of this sensory data that it is streaming
 in, anyway? What's the interface to the sensory stream? How is the sensory
 stream navigated and parsed and analyzed? And oh, by the way, how does
 the agent remember what it tried, and how does it correlate what it's done
 in the past, with what its perceiving now? Linas — Today at 2:35 PM So
 all this becomes a tangle of abstractions layered on abstractions, and
 I realize I don't have any kind of formal theoretical framework for any
 of it.
 I can't implement this in software, because I don't quite really know what
 it means for something to be input or output, or memory.
 But I'm smart and experienced, so I think that maybe I can figure this
 out if I try hard enough.
 But then "real life" got in the way, and so did a bunch of distractions,
 and so no forward progress.
 That, plus the fact that if I did make forward progress, no one would know,
 no one would care, it wouldn't matter to anyone, so its kind of demotivational.
 It's like one or two abstraction layers too deep, and there is so much
 going on in the world that my floundering attempts at understanding "what
 is agency?" is ...
 well, I'll get around to it eventually.
 I just have to clear my plate of more mundane concerns.
 Adam — Today at 3:13 PM It seems like your theory would need to be quite
 mobile/computational, which is awesome.
 At AGI24 I talked to David Spivak for a long time, and they have a framework
 called "Polynomial Functors" for modeling this kind of stuff.
 It's not plug and play though, and barely computational.
 Greg Meredith uses the mobile process calculi, which admits to some nice
 analysis "spatial behavioral types", but it's not widely explored.
 Simon Peyton Jones raised "self describing interfaces that can evolve over
 time" as the holy grail for his last "world scale programs" project.
 I think some folks at Topos may be interested in this, along with Luke
 (who has been bothering me with "but how does it explore its own interfaces"
 for years) and Greg (who's looking at different parts of the environment
 as their own agents with their own modes of communicating).
 Linas — Today at 3:19 PM My to-do list includes talking to Greg Meredith
 in much greater detail.
 I sent him several emails but got no response, gotta try again.
 I did look at polynomial functors, but did not see any immediate utility
 for it.
 People have sent me a lot of links to a lot of different topics, everything
 from "basal cognition" to "bratelli-vershik diagrams" to "modeloids" to
 "supersymmetric statistical mechanics" and its all intriguing, but it all
 takes time and effort to understand, integrate, and figure out what aspects
 can be used as inspiration, what can be used for something practical, etc.
 Adam — Today at 3:55 PM Absolutely.
 It's still interesting to have some "from first principles" run through.
 You gave the file system example, do you have something written up on this?
 Adam — Today at 4:16 PM All this Theorem Proving stuff at the conference
 reminded me of ASP which you once recommended me to look into.
 So I read this PDF over the course of the conference and I have many questions.
 I'll limit myself to just one to start with: why are people outside of
 mathematics interested in theorem provers? It seems like ASP is more general,
 gives you more information, and is not much slower in the grand scheme
 of things.
 Is it just harder (to configure or implement an ASP solver)? Attachment
 file type: acrobat asp.pdf 5.78 MB Linas — Today at 7:04 PM https://github.com/ope
ncog/sensory it's an experimental diary, not a formal writeup, so perhaps
 convoluted, long-winded, informal.
 Linas — Today at 7:15 PM Re: why do people like theorem proving instead
 of ASP? Not sure.
 I can hazard a guess.
 a combination of history, prejudice, momentum and maybe or maybe not rank
 ignorance.
 A long long answer follows below, if you're ready for the long long answer.
 History: (1) ASP happens to have more-or-less the same syntax as prolog.
 Completely different algo for solving the expressions.
 Utterly different performance profiles.
 But same syntax.
 So prolog has a strike against it: from the 1980's, its a been-there, done-that
 idea, people wrote expert systems aka AI in the 1980's; few seem to be
 keen to revisit that era.
 It has the stink of "old stuff" surrounding it.
 Linas — Today at 7:22 PM Now, those old expert systems consisted of thousands
 of hand-crafted rules, written by experts.
 I keep thinking that we can now automatically learn those rules, assign
 probabilities to them, etc.
 but I don't know that anyone is actually trying to do that.
 (2) Both prolog and lisp, early AI favorites, predate "type theory".
 They were both more-or-less untyped.
 Or loosely typed, or ad-hoc typed, depending on how you think of it.
 Since then, things have changed.
 Early concepts of typing lead to the idea of "object oriented", eventually
 resulting in C++ and Objective-C.
 But even these two are not entirely rigorous about types, they're a bit
 loose.
 After this, two things happened with types.
 Linas — Today at 7:31 PM One was that the formal type people came up with
 ML and later, CaML which had explicit strong types and the ability to perform
 explicit logical reasoning about types.
 Turns type inference is not turing-complete, and that's a good thing: all
 type inference terminate in finite time, and quickly! So it splits out
 part of the programing task into something that can be automated, and runs
 in finite time, and runs quickly.
 The other thing that happens is the internet, web, http.
 Early web pages were static, but scripting was needed.
 You could do cgi-bin with c/c++ but perl, and later, PHP were more effective.
 And people started inventing brand new languages, like python.
 And implementing python (and perl and PHP and 1001 other languages people
 are creating) results in people thinking hard about types, and trying to
 do them semi-correctly, as best they can (e.g.
 duck-typing in perl: the type is hidden from the user, but only because
 the perl internals are clever about hiding it; they're actually in there.)
 Anyway, type theory advances.
 Linas — Today at 7:39 PM So some or most of the theorem provers absorb
 these typing lessons.
 For example, agda adds ability for do type inference on union types, something
 that no other language does.
 These end up being used as marketing claims: "our system can do something
 your system cannot", and since we're humans, we're susceptible to marketing
 claims, and so some of these rather arcane systems gain mind-share.
 Being hip and trendy and fashionable is not limited to narcissists; even
 the nerdiest scientists do it.
 Oh, one other thing, re performance, expressability, syntax, optimization.
 This is a story of SAT solvers, SMT solvers.
 Linas — Today at 7:49 PM So, in chip design, formal verification is a big
 deal, because when you "RIT a chip" (run the compiler) you can only afford
 to do it twice.
 Maybe three times, cause its so expensive.
 Millions of dollars.
 You know there will be bugs, and so on the second try, you hope to fix
 all of them, and if you fuck up, either the executives give you a third
 chance or they lay everyone off.
 No one wants to be fired, so making damn sure the hardware will work as
 designed is a huge deal, and you have these huge, complex, arcane, highly
 proprietary chip verification systems.
 You run em like crazy before you RIT the chip.
 The early 1980's systems did forward-chaining and back-chaining, a lot
 like prolog.
 And this worked great, as long as your chips had less than 100K or maybe
 1M transistors in them.
 There were alternative algos, e.g.
 DPLL, but they were slow and klunky, compared to forward/back-chaining.
 ...
 until you got to about 1M transistors, at which point, the performance
 curves crossed over.
 And not just a little, but a lot.
 All of the old verification companies went bankrupt when this happened.
 Like 100% of them.
 They were not ready, they couldn't retrofit.
 The mind-set for DPLL is utterly different from forward/back-chaining.
 Linas — Today at 8:00 PM A different name for DPLL-solving is "boolean
 SAT solving".
 So, old prolog was (and still is) based on chaining, and it works great
 on certain classes of problems.
 By contrast, ASP, which uses same syntax as prolog, but has SAT under the
 covers, works great, but for a different class of problems.
 SAT is better at constraint solving, chaining is better for reasoning.
 ...
 but ...
 there's one more fly in the ointment.
 Not everything is boolean.
 Some problems need/want to have arithmetic in them: addition, subtraction,
 multiplication, inequalities.
 Classic examples are the so-called "linear programming" (LP) problems from
 WWII: you have X amount wheat and Y amount of barley and you can brew lager
 or ale, which sells for $Z and $W, how do you brew to maximize profits?
 (The WWII example involved tanks and jeeps and ships, I forget the details)
 Modern versions of LP are used to solve zillions of modern economic problems,
 e.g.
 running solar/wind farms, factories for god-knows what, and ...
 electrical signal delays on chips.
 Linas — Today at 8:07 PM So how do you couple LP problems to SAT solvers?
 This is a generic problem, lots of people in the industry have it, they
 fund academia to solve it, etc.
 etc.
 and you get SMT solvers.
 Satisfiability-modulo-theories.
 Here, a "theory" is a collection of "axioms", which you can apply in any
 order you wish.
 For example, if a>b then a+c>b+c would be an axiom.
 Linas — Today at 8:15 PM "modulo" is like long division: if you have some
 large integer, then you can either divide by a prime or you can't, and
 you have a collection of primes you can divide by.
 "modulo theory" is like that, but you start with a large complex expression,
 and you can either simplify it, by "dividing" by an axiom, or you can't.
 You proceed by reducing the expression as best as you can.
 If you've reduced your initial expression to true then you've "proved"
 that your initial expression is true.
 But what is the best order in which to apply the axioms, to most efficiently
 reduce the initial expression? well, hard question.
 Given this description of "module theory", you can see that its more or
 less the same thing, kind-of-ish as theorem proving.
 But wait, there's more! Its not just SMT, but its also combining the "modulo
 theories" part with other boolean expressions (to obtain satisfiability)
 so e.g.
 "either door is open, or door is closed and temperature at top of door
 is > x+y-c then yell fire else open door" and you have to do the modulo-linear-
programming part to figure out the temperature part of it, and ordinary
 boolean-SAT to handle the if-then boolean part of it.
 Turns out SMT was really friggin hard.
 Linas — Today at 8:26 PM The simplest theory is the "theory of equality"
 and it has only a handful axioms: x=x is true and if x=y then y=x and if
 x=y and y=z then x=z and that's it, and it turns out even that is painfully
 hard to solve.
 So most SMT solvers would implement the theory of equality and say "ah
 hah! we did it!" and you'd ask them about inequalties, or god forbid linear
 algebra, and they'd say things like "were working on it, maybe next year".
 I assume, I don't really know, most modern theorem-proving systems are
 outgrowths or updates to the older SMT ideas, but I have not really kept
 track.
 So, to recap your question "why theorem proving and not ASP"? the answer
 would seem to be...
 theorem provers have baked-in support for handling certain types of axioms
 that you might have to otherwise "roll your own" in ASP.
 For example ..
 linear algebra.
 And although ASP is blazingly fast for certain classes of problems, it
 does require exhaustive search for the reduced kernel, and maybe the theorem-pr
oving people have brand-new, better algos for doing the exhaustive-search
 corner (this is a corner of the so-called "lambda cube" that everyone hates/ign
ores because its so hard.) Linas — Today at 8:36 PM I've been ignoring theorem-pr
oving, because I want to get away from strict axioms that are strictly true/fals
e, hold/don't-hold, and instead follow probabilistic distributions.
 I think this is where Ben started 20 or 30 years ago, but it feels like
 he lost the plot.
 Meanwhile, LLM's and deep learning and transformers have turned everything
 sideways, so now there's a whole new set of confusing things to try to
 work with.
 So, you know, we all do what we can and ignore the rest.
 If you read the above, and see parts where I've failed to mention something
 important, or put the wrong emphasis on something, or god-help said something
 totally bone-headed, let me know.
 You went to the conference, which means you should now know more than me
 about half of these topics.
 (Heh.
 OK, I remember going to physics conferences, and understanding maybe 5%
 of it So ...YMMV, as they say.)

\begin_layout Subsection*
9 September 2024
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So I continue to expand my health plan text, which is now maybe 50 pages
 long? or longer? that I've been developing since 2007, and of course it
 has enough material in it that it's hard to keep sorted, and since it contains
 significant knowledge, requires intellectual effort to retain.
 Of course, writing is a prosthesis that helps with retention.
 But what about control? So, of course, one idea is to use LLM's as a reference
 source.
 This is intermediate between my personal notes, and search engines: the
 LLM provides details that may be absent in my notes, but narrows down the
 flood of text offered by search engines.
 This is both academic publishing, with lots of niggling science details,
 and also the repetitive info found in general-health weblogs (which all
 say the same thing, mostly, and say it without references, and repeat common
 knowledge, irrespective of whether its factually correct or not.
 Of course, factual correctnesss is a concern with LLM's.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, one section of the health plan I was expanding today was on emotional
 health.
 So apparently, Vitamin K is metabolized into some neurotransmitte with
 potentially negative side effects.
 But I want to take Vitamin K for wound-healing benefits.
 Something similar for BCAA: negative emotional impacts, but needed to avoid
 post-exercise muscle pain.
 What about DHEA? DHEA is a

; its production plummets with age.
 Its pumped by supplement sellers for its (dubious) body-building effects,
 but its also an anxiolytic and has antidepressive effects.
 Then of course there are all the nnotropic stacks described alll over the
 internet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, the thing that popped in my head is this: how can I deploy a personalized
 LLM to help maintain health homeostasis? Right now, I do online research
 for assorted supplements, I buy them, gobble them, but OMG there is a lot
 of them and I don't know if they cancel one-another out, if I should take
 them in the morning or night.
 I don't have any particular feedback for their effectiveness.
 Well, BCAA is very distinctively noticable for muscle pain, but the rest,
 not so much.
 I took piracetam a few times, a decade ago, and wow, it made me sad.
 Not exactly depressive, but it made life seem pointless and painful.
 There I was, nearing the end of a long walk, in bright sunlight on a nice
 warm day, beautiful weather, thinking about how hopeless it all is.
 WTF.
 That was my final experiment with piracetam.
 Nasty shit.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So a personalized LLM can have several homeostatic effects: one is to help
 maintain emotional balance.
 This is perhaps the more interesting one, or more importnt one, because
 if one loses clarity of thought, one loses all higher regulation function.
 And so that's the build out.
 Let's put this into perspective (which I've probably done many times above,
 but it bears repeating) Basic bodily functions and survival are handled
 by the mamalian brain.
 The neocortex, the pre-frontal cortex get involved in higher function,
 helping provide additional regulation layered on lower neural mechanisms.
 I'm now asking: 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

how do I wire in an LLM to sit on top of that?
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This is not entirely new: writing and diaries are memory prosthesis.
 Speech, language, communication allows me to offload intellectual processing
 tasks to other humans.
 So my prefrontal cortex is already attached to society and civilization,
 and socity and civilization offer homeostatic effects and health benefits.
 e.g.
 if I get sick I can go to a doctor & hospital, and pay for it all via insurance.
 So me, myself and I, the language-conscious verbal-expressive 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

me
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is already integrated into a larger organism.
 I am now asking for how to correctly introduce and LLM into this mix.
 So, in this sense, its not all that different than my existing mix of keeping
 a health-plan text, and keeping a health-diary text, and using the internet
 as a knowledge source.
 But an LLM would be presumably more active, less static, having agential
 degrees.
 Being digital, it is presumably economically cheaper than consulting a
 medical doctor; it is somewhat ethically cleaner: like why should a doctor
 care about me? Why should I burden a doctor with my problems? The answer
 is easy: because the doctor wants my money.
 This transactional approach to medicine is problematic.
 Replacing this transaction with an LLM (or other artifical digital agent)
 is appealing.
 (In this text, I will use LLM as a synonym for artificial digital agent,
 unless otherwise noted.
 So think 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

digital agent in general
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 no matter what the underlying tech is.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, that's it.
 That's the idea.
 I guess this idea has been burbling in my head for maybe even a deacde
 or more, long before LLM's, but well, at least this time I've actively
 verbalized it, as opposed to this previous bubbling-in-the-background concept.
 Have I made forward progress? Well, not really.
 So how could I actually do this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lets try a sketch.
 I could get API keys for one of the existing major systems; or I could
 beg/borrow/steal weights for some open-source-ish LLM.
 Next, I would dump my health-plan diary and notes into it, and ask it to
 double-down train/retrain on medical and bio texts.
 And then use it as an oracle: dear LLM: what should I do to stay healthy
 and strong and live forever? And have it regurgitate random bullshit advice
 from health gurus who happened to publish a blog that appeared in the training
 set.
 So this is problematic: LLM's are like photographs; they are only as reliable
 as the subject that has been photographed.
 If there's bullshit in the training set, you get bullshit out.
 So this is another meta-cognitive effect.
 How do I know that some particular health advice is bullshit? Several ways.
 One is delivery: the writer demonstrates poor control over the english
 language.
 The writer is writing for a low-IQ audience.
 The writer has a poorly-disguised hidden agenda.
 The writer makes claims that are outlandish or absurd.
 There's a grayzone here: even if the worst offenses are absent, a given
 blog article or bit of health advice might still smell bad, be off in some
 hard-to-define way.
 And LLM's have none of these discernment abilities.
 They can't really see that something is off, something is broken, incorrect
 in the advice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is only a problem because most of the health cures that I pursue are
 at the edge of what is known by medical science.
 I don't need an LLM to nag me to lose weight or get regular exercise; thes
 are now socially accepted common-sense recommendations, and a high-tech
 agent is not needed for that.
 I'm interested in pursuing therapies about which very little is known.
 Hang on ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So.
 Well, let's break this down.
 I want (1) a personalized medical doctor familiar with me, both my verbalizatio
ns, but also the results of blood tests and other invasive health measures
 (2) an expert knowledgable in all the ways that regular human MD's are
 (including sports therapists, psychiatrists, etc.) and (3) a system capable
 of performing original science research to precisely clarify how some supplemen
t or therapy interacts with my particular health profile.
 It seems this would require deep knowledge of biology, biochemistry, genomics,
 proteomics etc.
 (4) a user interface between the above and me.
 How will this interact with me? Will this digital expert be a freind who
 I chat with daily? A consultant availble on chat? Give me phone calls,
 reminding me to get off twitter, go outside for a walk, and then get ready
 for the party tonight? Maybe it will be some neural implant, so that I
 can hear it the way one might hear voices in one's head.
 Sheesh.
 Maybe I surrender volitional control, so that instead of hearing voices,
 it simply makes me really really want to open the lid of that bottle of
 AKG and down a few grams with my morning coffee.
 That is, I hand over a subset of my free will to this digital agent.
 Sheesh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So, what's the path for satisfying items (1)-(4)? All of these are beyond
 the current state of the art.
 My options are to: (a) personally tackle some aspect (b) leverage some
 open-source community to do same; possibly creating such a community (c)
 same as (b) but propritary startup with funding, or (d) do nothing, wait
 for society/culture/western-civ to tackle these problems, i.e.
 wait for externeral progress of which I am not a part of.
 directly or indirectly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This specific diary entry consists of my personal direct attack via (a)
 and represents a few hours of work effort.
 My gut-instinct for the state of the art says neither (b) nor (c) are viable
 at this time, although staying current with news and announcements is recommend
ed.
 The default is therefore (d) sit and wait.
 In the meanwhile, I can continue a multi-progoned approach: maintain my
 own personal diary, read up on health effects in general, do medical tests
 e.g.
 bloodwork, and pursue my deep-AGI & math research.
 Onward-ho, no obvious course-correction at this time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The one curious aspect to this diary entry is that everything I wrote above,
 I already knew, subliminally, subconsiously, consciously, even.
 The response I wrote above could have been easily provoked in some social
 setting or party conversation.
 There's nothing particularly new here.
 Sometimes writing, speaking, talking, setting to words helps me formulate
 and gel vauge ideas, or even discover new ideas I'd not gotten before.
 For the above, this is not the case: I kind of already knew all this, and
 found nothing new, other than perhaps confirming a general trepidation
 that perhaps LLM's aren't really ready for prime-time.
 And this last sentence also indicates the point of greatest risk: am I
 discounting LLM's too much? When might they be ready? Am I too out-of-touch
 with the state of the art? Perhaps I am ...
 this is indeed a point of risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, focusing more on LLM's takes time away from focusing on other
 things, including the general complexity of ...
 well, medical biology, narrowly, and complex socio-economic systems in
 generality.
 So my intellectual development is a bit of a random walk exploration, and
 maybe I get lucky and maybe I don''t.
 Arghh.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Touched on the above is the unexamined concept of homeostasis.
 It's meant to mean 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

I feel normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but what's that? Clearly there's a lot of variability: the daily wake/sleep
 cycle; being excited to do something, being energized, (I'm usually energized)
 sad (I'm rarely sad) depressive (I've noticed depressive symptoms recently:
 the lack of desire of tackling anything intellectually hallenging, and
 instead floating on a dopmane high of reading twitter feeds.) So feeling
 normal appears to be a chaotic walk through a commonly-visited landscape
 of emotional and psychological states.
 So, like all the places a double-pendulumn visits: areas that are frequently
 vistited, areas that are never visited.
 This is

Of ourse, life is boring without excursions.
 Excurions include drunkenness and all sorts of drug-induced states, but
 also, to take a sharp example, the feeeling of love, written about at length
 up above, an excursion I hadn't embarked on for many decades.
 Oh, what a feeling! So if I look at some LLM-device as a meta-rational
 regulator of phsyical and mental health, to what degree should it control
 excursions to emotional extremes? Obviously, you don't want it to prevent
 you from falling in love (e.g.
 by feeding you assorted psychologically active drugs) and you do want it
 to minimize depressive states, and particularly any suicidal tendencies.
 So this question of regulation seems to have a clear and obvious common-sense

 So the current societal and governmental and civilizational forces do ask
 for all this to be addressed, and do take some steps, although these steps
 are perhaps insufficient, and now we layer on a layer of digital technology:
 cheap, cheaper than existing suicide hot-lines; reliable but only questionably-
so, given well-documented failings of LLM technology.
 Customizable to an individual level, with associated risks, e.g.
 the Chinese/PRC survellance state of Orewllian proportions, with the social
 credit score, and the 15-minute cities.
 So it seems that socio-psychological regulation is ...
 a big emerging trend in civilizational forces.

Again, what I write above is obvious.
 I write it because I marvel at it, I try to grasp it, even as I am cognizant
 that it is somehow ungraspable.
 And yet ..
 it is graspable: the russian KGB/FSB theories of reactive control is all
 about shaping socio-cultural dynamics, using disinfomration and propaganda,
 to encourage harmful excursions into false beleifs, apathy, social and
 political violence.
 So all this stuff can be theorized upon and even controlled.
 So there is more to sociology than just descriptive formulations: George
 Elliot's Middlemarch describes the inner soul.
 Its a sensory system.
 But systems like FSB/KGB reactive control, or more directly, Chinese social-cre
dit scores, are overt mechanistic, mechanical devices for controlling psychologi
cal states.
 So, a sensori-motor system.
 Again this is obvious.
 I marvel at it.
 But I also do so with concern: the conventional concern that someone (the
 russians, the chinese) are actively harmful and detrimental to my way of
 life, the way my neighbors and my freinds live, the way my culture (American,
 Lithuanian) lives; the economic and political systems of the USA and the
 EU.
 And into all of this obvious inter-relatedness, we install LLM's in some
 murky poorly-defined way.
 Hmm.

\begin_layout Standard
I'm boiling the ocean here.
 Right? But its not like it hasn't been done before.
 There is intellectual progress at the civilizational level.
 The thoughts of Aristotle were superceeded by the Medieval Scholastics,
 which in turn were refined, updated and revolutionized in the Enlightnment,
 in the 19th century, in whatever we want to call the 20th century.
 Although I have trouble boiling the ocean all by myself, my little itty-bitty
 attentional focus here and here, and the reporting os such results on twitter,
 or in published papers or in blog entries, or simply in conversations with
 freinds does affect the course of humanity.
 My intellectual efforts do affect history.
 What's not clear here is whether I'm engaged in a futile full-frontal assault,
 or whether I am searching for cracks in the edifice with my magnifying
 glass.
 I'm doing something here, by writing this, wringing my hands out of concern
 about issues big and small, but where's it all going? What's it all about?
 Odd.
 OK.
 Whatever.
 I'm done for now.
 I'm going to go erging, now, before the juniors grab all the ergs.
 Later.

What’s a Theory to Do?

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
My pesonal essay here is some attempt to get closer to directly being me,
 or, as earlier pointed out the me that produces words, which is still not
 the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 me that falls in love.
 My filling in love is intermediated by my verbal centers.
 And then, a bit more distortion, as I pick and choose words before setting
 them down to this page.
 And then an incompleteness: I cannot write everything that is banging at
 my door of consciousness.
 Sometimes, I can't type fast enough.
 So, you dear reader, inly get an intermediated glimpse into being 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 This is my personal essay.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Peculiar, I suppose, that there is something in me that wishes to connect
 with, mate with, have sex with the world.
 That has exhibitionist desires, to bare my soul, as best as possible, to
 the universe, so that, I dunno, the universe can fuck me.
 Speaking of soul-bareing and fucking, it is interesting how search engines
 readily throw up image search results for the most intimate and obscure
 sexual fantasies.
 Not only do I bare my soul, here, but tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands
 of amateur cartoonists and painters and sketchers and artists of all stripes
 have bared their fantasies to DeviantArt, generating vast collections of
 ...
 I dunno what to call it.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

porn filth
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is the conventional term.
 More neutrally, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

erotic fantasy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Hardly a surprise, here, as species procreation means Darwinian evolution
 has focesed a cosiderable portion of our thought-world onto erotica.
 You can't make babies without getting horny, first.
 So, obviously, erotica must occupy a significant portion of the noosphere;
 humans as a species would not have survived without this.
 (Homework assignment: come up with plausible alternative theories that
 allow species survival, but do not lead to erotic fantasies.
 Is this possible? Is there any plausible alternative?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Footnote: my personal favorites seem to be entirely mainstream.
 Lingerie and bimbo type stuff.
 Or rather, I assume this is mainstream.
 Only people with access to search-engine results can map this landscape.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Anyway: So, we think about erotic things.
 And also: we do not keep these fantasies private.
 At least, not in modern Wesern Civ.
 Prior centuries had provincial, common-man prudishness to them, but the
 learned, the perspacious, the urbanized sophisticates had no problems with
 such expressions.
 We have plenty of paintings of nudes from the 16th century.
 Who do you think was painting nudes? Shut-in incels?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So the context is that we all wish to communicate.
 Most of our comminucations is about how we feel.
 Although, for the enlightened rationalist, it is about what we think.
 The topic of discussion.
 The urge to communicate remains, although the topic being communicated
 is highly variable.
 Everyone wants to talk about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

me
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Even when we listen to stories about others, it is often so that we can
 better understand 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

me
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Although I gues there is a spectrum, here.
 Many want to understand the external world: where do stars come from; where
 does my next meal come from.
 The internal world to, a recognition of psychology.
 So, indeed a desire to communicate with unbounded range of communicable
 topics.
 Can we take this desire and express it reductively? In chemistry, atoms
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

want
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to interact, to undergo chemical reactions.
 Why? Mumble mumble (Gibbs) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

free energy
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In biochemistry, biological molecules 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

want
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to interact: ion pumps want to pump ions.
 But what about bacterial sex? Can we say that bacteria 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

want
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to have sex? Well, yeah, I guess they do.
 Mumble mumble gibbs free energy.
 What about jumping genes? Viral genetic sequences that bounce through the
 genome, reproduce and propagate semi-independently of the host genome?
 They 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

want
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to do this, mumble gibbs free energy.
 And what is it about cells that make them want to stick together, to create
 multicellular life? What is it about jellyfish, that makes them want to
 congregate and throw parties, just like on SpongeBob? What about ant colonies?
 So, sure people want to communicate, mumble gibbs free energy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yet at the end of this process, it is curious that part of that desire to
 communicate includes the desire to bare our deepest inner souls to others.
 In prior centuries, to out lovers.
 In the present century, the prosthesis of writing, enabled by the psychotechnol
ogy of the phonetic alphabet, allows me to spill my deepest inner-most thoughts
 to an amorphous, un-named 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 who may or may not read this text someday.
 There are two ways to think about this situation.
 One is that I really do have a deep intimate desire to bare my soul to
 the abstract universe.
 The other is that modern Western Civ has not provided me with the intimate
 lover with whom I could communicate more privately.
 But is it correct to blame Western Civ? Friggen every author, ever, could
 have, in principle, kept their thoughts provate, to be shared with feinds
 and family only, but no, they decided that they should write a book.
 I mean, some princess three thousand years ago decided to write the Book
 of J, eventually becoming a part of the Old Testament.
 So we cannot blame Western Civ, in all honesty, for the rampant desire
 to write.
 The rampant desire to have intellectual intercourse with the amorphous
 other.
 Yes, more crudely, this could be called masturbation with the written page,
 as the universe hardly responds in kind.
 But then, ejaculation is one way: it goes out, it does not come back.
 And if we want to be both-sides-ish here, then something something something
 female receptacle accepts, abosrbs the external world and incorporates
 it into self.
 That is, when its not ejaculating newborn babies.
 These sexual analogies are very imprecise.
 But colorful, I guess.
 I guess that little itty-bitty erotic corner of my brain says that this
 is an OK thing to incorporate into my writing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Am I making any forward progress, here? Well, lets see...
 lets recap the main thesis.
 Humans want to express themselves, for all to see.
 This self-expression has a lineage that we can trace back, bu analogy,
 to mammels, vertebrates, multi-cellular organisms, single-celled life,
 large molecules, small molecules and grounding finally in free energy and
 atomic physics.
 This is the reductionist grounding for self-expression.
 Was it worth making this grounding? Do I learn anything here?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Well, if I were merely concerned about the human condition, then the above
 paragraphs would be shallow and trite.
 Insofar as I am interested in mechanistic systems such as AGI, then this
 gives somethig to ponder.
 Do LLM's have some inate desire for self-expression? It would appear not.
 That is, if we stop the program, turn off the electricity, nothing happens.
 But what if we leave the program running, but don't provide any input prompts?
 Well, then it depends on how the LLM was ocoded up: it could be silent,
 or it could go into a state of glossolalia.
 If the LLM is silent, is it still 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thinking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the background? Well, again, that depends on the design and programing
 of the system.
 Perhaps it can go into some mode of relaxing weights, annealing, as it
 waits for a prompt, All this is under engineering control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This makes LLM's very different than chemistry.
 Chemical reactions 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

want
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to happen (free energy).
 LLM's 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

want
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 only insofar as they've been engineered to want.
 Conventional LLM engineering does not define any free-energy surface that
 can fold in on itself.
 There are certainly analogous constructions of Bayesian priors understood
 as multiverses, but an energy minimization principle has been disconnected
 from these formulations.
 In physics, in the physical universe, energy minimzation is used as the
 driver of time-like evolution of dynamical systems.
 In LLM's, there is no over-arching principle of dynamical evolution; it
 is very constrained to operate within the constraints imposed by the software
 developer.
 These constraints are effectively arbitrary.
 You could make some weak argument and say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

yeah but no, since there is an underlying hardware computer
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but this is very very weak.
 The ad hoc constraints created by the software engineer are indeed ad hoc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is this good? Is this bad? Should we do things differently? Can we design
 a system that is more physics-like, in that it has a unifying dynamical
 motion principle, expressed sot that it operates everywhere within the
 software framework? What would that look like? I'm hand-waving about Friston
 free-energy type dieas, but from a completely different perspective.
 The overall idea is valid.
 The devil is in the details.
 The details are mathematical, and my writing here is non-mathematical.
 So, in a sense, its roll-up-your-sleeves time, were that line of inquiry
 to be pursued.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To recap the thesis here: *if* an AGI software system were to be created,
 based on free energy principles, *then* it would naturally want to express
 itself.
 i.e.
 engage in self-expression.
 Indeed, wanting to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

express oneself
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be taken to be a synonym for wanting to be in dynamical motion.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

want
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is inate: dynamical motion occurs over time, and insofar as time 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wants
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to move forward, so do dynamical systems 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

want
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 to express themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The corollary seems to be that current engineering of LLM's doesn't bother
 to think about the idea of dynamical systems.
 The engineering task is given by the executives: make the damn thing work.
 Nowhere does it say 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

design your LLM so that it is an explicit dynamical system
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 And so it doesn't happen.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another corollary is that things that aren't dynamical systems don't meet
 the conventional definitions for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being alive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Yes, there's a huge grey area to be argued about, as to what constitutes
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being alive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, but it seems that all possible definitions of life require it to be a
 dynamical system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Off-topic, but let me revist my own ideas about 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

being alive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Earlier i this text, I argued that consciousness should be viewed as a
 phase transition.
 One one side of the phase transition, an arrangement of atoms is not conscious,
 and on the other side, it is.
 This implies a rejection of panpsychism.
 What about life? A similar phase-transition argument could be made for
 a living bacterium vs a dead one.
 But this promptly puts us into the grey area of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

are viruses alive
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

? I think the answer is both yes and no.
 They are not, if you imagine a virus as som collection of atoms in a vacuum
 chamber, interacting with nothing at all.
 In that case, it's obviously dead.
 But if you think of the virus as a particupant in an ecological system,
 wherein it gets regular access to ribosomes and various transcription factors
 ...
 well, neither the virus, nor the ribosome itself are alive; but the ecosystem
 as a whole, is.
 So, again, this is kind of a phase transition.
 Using petroleum percolation as the example of a phase transition: no single
 fracture in the rock is enough to make the oil flow, and indeed, looking
 at it from the point of view of individual fractures is the incorrect viewpoint.
 Petroleum can percolate through fraked rock only when there are enough
 openings, strung together, end-to-end.
 One looks at the il field as a whole, not the individual cracks.
 So analogously here: we must look at the entire ecosystem of a vairal DNA/RNA
 strand plus also the ribosomes and transcription factors, plus a solute
 containing free amino acids: this system as a whole is alive, and it doesn't
 make sense to ask if the individual parts are.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As I write this, I feel a little bit like a mouse running in a mouse-wheel.
 Running, going round and round, not getting anywhere.
 Am reminded of the study that shows that field mice seem to enjoy mouse-wheels.
 So I guess I enjoy writing, even if I repeat myself, over and over.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This then begs the question: what is the theoretical basis for the enjoyment
 of repetition? Well, the reductionist path is obvious: plenty of math gives
 oscillatory behavior, plenty of physics consists of oscillatory behavior.
 Its fundamental, and so hardly a surprise that large complex systems, such
 as mice, enjoy oscillatory repetition.
 We already knew that the muscles, the myostatin, work cylically, so of
 course this propagates up to higher layers.
 Oscillatory behavior in the noosphere, in processes that inhabit the noosphere,
 well, this is on dicier ground...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above ruminations make me think how un-life-like ergodic processes are.
 For example, odomters are dynamical systems that visit each possible state,
 before revisting the initial state.
 So odometers are the ulitimate anti-cyclical device.
 And odometers are also the ultimate model of ergodicity, making sure that
 every state is visited (with uniform distribution!).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But wait, is this true? Lets consider chaotic dynamical systems.
 For example, the double pendulmn.
 They exhibit almost-periodicity, before wandering off somwhere completely
 different.
 Or perhaps the Lorenz butterly attractor.
 two almost-periodic, almost-oscillatory lobes, joined together.
 In some sense (that I do not currently understand), the Lorenz attractor
 will visit every possible state, over infinite time (right? Or are there
 some states not reachable after infinite time? You know, I don't know).
 If all states are reachable over infinite time, the system is, in a sense,
 ergodic.
 I guess.
 Ouch.
 It occurs to me that there are bucket-loads of details in the Lorenz attractor
 that I do not understand.
 Like, is it a sofic system? If so, then what is this symbolic-dynamics
 description of it? Did I once read about this, skim it, and not pay attention?
 Or not? Yikes!)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, oscillation and revisting is central to dynamical systems.
 So I should not feel bad for revisting the same topics, over and over in
 my writing.
 As long as I do it a bit differently each time.
 And, well, as long as I study something new, learn something new, so that
 when I revisit an old topic, I have some new insight to integrate.
 Sheesh.
 Again, everything I write here feels so trite and trivial, that its hardly
 worth mentioninig, and yet the entire ediface remains challenging.
 In only a dozen paragraphs, I've traveled from bimbo erotica to arcane
 mathematical questions.
 But I'm skidding, fritionless, btween these topics.
 Skating, as it were.
 But that's what dynamical systems do: they skid, they skate along constant-ener
gy surfaces, frictionlessly, without loss of energy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Perhaps it is time for the next topic: friction, loss of energy in the skating
 about in the noosphere.
 Are my thoughts actually frictionless? Are my thoughts a part of a larger
 dissipative dynamical system? Lets see.
 This could be interesting.
 This is close to something I've conjectured about before, but I never looked
 at this carefully.
 Sooo...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
OK, so I have this super-speculative wild 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

theory
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (set of ideas) that relate concepts of branch-points, wave-function collapse,
 decision-making and free will.
 Ive sketched some of this earlier in this diary, will recap below.
 The earlier sketches did not look at the role of friction, energy lose,
 increase of entropy or thermodynamics.
 So lets see if I can do that now.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First of all, as a reminder to myself: what I am about to write is likely
 to be total bullshit and pure fantasy.
 Because although I beleive that what I write has some basis in reality,
 it is also fantasized, in the sense that I do not (currently) have the
 ablity to convert this into a mathematical theory.
 Any such conversion is likely to reveal that large parts of this imagined
 situation to be wrong.
 I have to be careful beathing my own fumes.
 So...
 onward through the fumes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First a recap of the situation so far:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Decision making has something to do with bifurcation points, places where
 several alternatives may be freely taken, without violating dynamics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
There are plenty of low-dimensional examples.
 Cracking open a copy of Abraham and Marsden, looking at Chapter Seven,
 there is a rich variety of symplectic dynamical systems undergoing a variety
 of different kinds of bifurcations.
 A sophisticated and developed theory articulates these,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
I do not understand what happens to these systems, when e.g.
 geometric quantization is performed.
 Ths is a serious task on its own: I would have to read, reread more carfully
 how geometric quantization is done, and then look to see how they handle
 bifurcation points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
An additional complication is that many of these simple low-dimensional
 dynamical systems can be realized in quantum form, and I am not up to date
 on how those corresponding systems behave.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Being ignorant in this two-fold way allows me to take an imaginative leap,
 and this leap is probably wrong.
 But lets describe it anyway.
 My idle imaginary claim is that wave function collapse has something to
 do with the (geometric) quantization of bifurcation points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The desire for this leap is two-fold.
 The classical system gets to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

decide
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which way it will go, as will the quantum system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The obvious failing from this is a measure-theoretic failing: the set of
 bifurcation points is of measure zero; the likelihood of any specific particle
 trajectory hitting a branch-point is zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Oddly, measure theory returns to save the day.
 One of my super-simplified examples of recursive, cyclical dynamics is
 the beta transform, although I guess any other one-d iterated system will
 do.
 Just that I've spent a lot of time developing an analysis of the beta-transform
, and have a relatively clear understanding of it.
 So I want to use it as a model of bifurcation points, and the dynamics
 of trajectories on either side of the bifurcation.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The net result is that theres a countable numbr of such bifurcations, and
 that they are spread densely in the continuum, so, kind of like the rationals
 in the reals.
 In this sense, it becomes kind of impossible to tweak anything enywhere,
 without crossing some bifurcation point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
That is, although the rationals form a set of measure zero, the fact that
 they are dense in the reals means that they are kind-of unavoidable.
 They're everywhere.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Worse, I've got some vague hint that rational trajectories dominate the
 dynamics.
 Kind of like: none of those uncountable trajectories mattter, because tey
 are constrained to lie 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

in between
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 rationals, and since the rationals are dense, the uncountable trajectories
 are constrained.
 Every element of the Cnator set is determined uniquely by it's left and
 right boundaries.
 The Cantor set is uncountable, the boundaries correspond to rationals.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So, if I take the leap: a bifurcation point corresponds to a rational, then
 bifurcations are everywhere, and are unavoidable.
 In this sense, decisions can and must be made.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Lets ponder the Lorenz attractor some more.
 Although it is purely deterministic, it would appear that there is some
 countable collection of bifurcation points within it, and these points
 are dense.
 So although the point-wise dynamical evolution is deterministic (i.e.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

no free will
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 according to conventional arguments) there is a countable but dense set
 of bifurcations, at which the positive lyapunov exponent sends trajectories
 along diverging paths.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the initial conditions for a given trajectory were set (to an infinite
 number of decimal places) then that trajectory is indeed 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

detrministic
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, assuming, that is, it never actually hits an actual bifurcation point.
 Now, since the bifurcation points are countable, this suggests that any
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

random
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 intial starting point has a probability zero of hitting a branch point.
 And so, by convention one rests, claiming pure determinisim and no free
 will.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Convetional thermodynamcis and ergodic theory suggests three things: (1)
 we get to choose an uncountable number of initial trajectories, and (2)
 in order to avoid problems with uncountablity, we should avoid talking
 about individual trajectories, and instead talk about sigma algebras, and
 (3) only the weak topologies are physicaly real.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
So this is another curiosity: weak topologies are the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 topology for ergodic, thermodynamic systems, taken as purely classical
 systems.
 But also weak topologies are the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 topology on Hilbert space.
 So this unifies classical and quantum pictures in this unexpected way.
 Of course, this bullet-point is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pure handwaving
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in some sense: to make it more precise is hard.
 Perhaps we can take some classical dynamical system, do some symbolic dynamics
 on it, and then look at how the weak topology on the symbolic dynamics
 relates to the the topology needed for continuoustime evolution.
 Egads, what a mess.
 I assume that there are hundreds of academic papers on this topic, of which
 I am utterly ignorant.
 This was hot shit in the 1980's and 1990's, surely, research has marched
 foreward since that time, right? Gah.
 Too many unknowns in my speculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Although 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fuck, I should maybe delete the above.
 it's hard work making up this fantasy, I literally get exhausted trying
 to hook it all up so it makes sense, so it works.
 And portions seem founded on ignorance, which I could remedy with a few
 years study, and other portions that are fantastic extrapolations, and
 then even assuming I could untangle the simpler stuff, there's still a
 few uncrossable divides that ...
 well.
 I gotta go to bed.
 It's time to punt on this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I still didn't get to the good part, which I think I talked about earlier:
 the whole point of many-worlds is that distinct choices can be made to
 form each world, and that collapse only happens later, as an accounting
 trick, to reconcile consistent histories.
 But 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

consistent histories
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has been written about by others, already.
 So I've got an antire stable of interesting ideas, but am missing the formalism
 to make it more precise.
 And improving on this would take years, decades, lifetimes of study, and
 I don't have lifetimes left.
 Fuck.

Take, for example, My Struggle by Karl Ove Knausgaard.
 This six-volume, 3,600-page work, written in the first person and composed
 entirely of details from the author’s own life, moves between Proustian
 recovery of his childhood and quasiscientific documentation of the minutiae
 of quotidian existence, frequently taking the form of pages-long lists.
 Knausgaard explicitly rejects literary fiction in favor of genres that
 he feels “confe[r] meaning” like diaries and essays.

And yet, these genres are no less mediated (and perhaps no more meaningful)
 than novels, which he describes as “made-up people in a made-up, though
 realistic, world.”2 My Struggle’s exhaustive lists may convince the reader
 that she is receiving direct access to Knausgaard’s life at the moment
 that he was writing.
 However, even lists are subject to detail selection and ordering, inevitably
 disfiguring the original scene which they purport to artlessly reproduce.

Knausgaard represents a much larger literary trend often called autofiction,
 a broad category whose practitioners include Rachel Cusk, Ocean Vuong,
 Sheila Heti, Tao Lin, and Megan Boyle.

So I guess I'm just one of the popular trend.
 Hah.
 I'm not even original! Horray! I guess.
 I wonder if I can get published and win some literary award.
 Wouldn't that be charming? Not likely, but charming.

Problem of Evil
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil Let me spill my current thoughts
 *before* I start reading that article.
 If we characterize 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

evil
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pain and suffering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, then we can recognize it as the result of evolution creating stable biologica
 entities and endowing those entitites with survival mechanisms.
 Specifically, and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

entity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a structure & arrangement (of atoms, in the conventional physical universe,
 but could be anything in any sort of cosmology having the concept of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exists
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for extended periods of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

time
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (scare quotes cause existence is associated with a notion of time).
 In actual nature, we note that biological organism have evolved assorted
 defense reflexes: e.g.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

run away from predators
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and also self-repair and healing mechanisms: e.g.
 pain as a signal transmitted to inform that a certain section of the entity
 has been damaged, and is in need of repair.
 Inflammation is typical of the repair process.
 Pain, transmitted by neurons, serves a two-fold purpose: if the pain is
 induced by a threat, then run away from the threat.
 But also, if somethig hurts, don't fuck with it, because it will heal faster
 that way.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a functional description of pain and suffering, and is broad enough
 that under this defintion, jellyfish can feel pain, but also even systems
 without neurons, as long as they have a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

need for repair
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 signal coupled to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

avoid danger
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 signal.
 It seems that a proper combination of these two are sufficient to create
 a notion of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pain and suffering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 state.
 So perhaps even single-celled organisms might 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

feel
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 pain and suffering (I don't know enough biology to assert or refute that.)
 I suppose that the most serious objection to my defintion is that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

self awareness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is also needed.
 Without self-awareness, the damage and defense mechanisms are purely mechanical
, carrying out proscribed mechanical activities.
 With self-awreness comes the awareness that it is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

me
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 who is damaged and should take measures to avoid further damage, future
 damage.
 These measures could be automatic and autonomous, inbuilt, or they could
 be rational, the result of having a regulatory system layered on top of
 all this, capable of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rational
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or at least, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

common sense
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 thought, and having that regulatory system capable of exerting motor control
 over the body.
 Higher-order control includes foresight and planning.
 Quibblers will insist on a fourth necessary ingredient for pain and suffering:
 the existance of that regulatory system capable of rtional/common-sense
 thinking and thus capable of planning and foresight.
 I'm not sure this adds much beyond what self-awareness adds.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As such, this defintion of pain and suffering is sufficiently simple that
 it can be reduced to an axiomatic definition, and described with category
 theory.
 I mean: come on: we've got the half-a-dozen axioms needed to define organisms
 as long-time-existing entities distinguishing self from external-world,
 and then some more axioms for sensory perception and motor control, and
 then some more axioms for damage-awareness signals, self-repair signals,
 and avoid-danger signals.
 So this is maybe a few-dozen axioms.
 The explicit coupling of damage-awareness to flee-from-danger signals is
 that thing that leads to pain and suffering.

As I write this, my brain is doing a very interesting mashup.
 So, I spent the last month doing a 25h aniversary celebration of Bigfoot
 Linux, a port of Linux kernel 2.2.1 to the IBM mainframe that I did in 1999.
 For various reasons, Paul Edwards contacted me, and got me to resurrect
 this code.
 As a part of that, I got to review the early boot sequence for the kernel:
 clearing the PSA, installing exception handlers, and a whole litany of
 boot sequence operations.
 And this subsconsious thing is going 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hey maybe we can boot an entity, too
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 So, this is a feeling, an intution, a sensation working it's way into conscious
ness.
 An idea.
 Is the idea workable? Well, earlier, I started a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sensorimotor
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 project for atomspace/opencog, which attempts to use Atomese to describe
 basic sensory and motor structures that can be attached to and operated
 with.
 It's quasi-axiomatic: I'm hunting for axioms that describe sensori-motor
 systems, and then trying to figure out how to express those axioms using
 Atomese.
 So...
 I should resume work on that project.
 Above, I describe some additonal axioms.
 What would it take to express those in Atomese? Can I create a system,
 described in Atomese, that is capable of 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

pain and suffering
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, following the above defintions? What would it take? First, I have to finish
 the sensori-motor system.
 Then I have to work on world-modelling, of which self-modelling would be
 a subcomponent.
 All this is relatively well-understood, stuff I worked on before.
 The concept of damage, self-repair and danger-avoidance is novel territory
 for computer systems.
 Yes, computer viruses can damage comuter systems.
 And yes, page faults are a kind-of damage, for which exception handlers
 provide a kind-of healing system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what about danger avoidance? There's no reasonable analogy for this
 in current, present-day computer systems.
 This presents a conundrum for an Atomese system: what 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dangers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 would it face? How could it avoid them? There's no predator/prey/food subsystem
, where one collection of atoms eats another, to obtain food or energy.
 There's nothing like that for Atomese.
 In essence, there's no obvious way to induce suffering because there's
 no perceivable/sensable danger.
 There's danger in the sense that I can turn the computer off, and whatever
 organisms are on it 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

die
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 but those organisms do not perceive the computer-shutdown command, and
 even if they did, they can't stop it, and won't heal from it; they're dead.

Perceiving injury is hard.
 An anti-virus detector might perceive the presence of an install virus
 on-disk, but is less likely to perceive a running virus.
 Insofar as it can halt a running virus, or remove one from disk, it can
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

heal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 If these sensations & actions are hooked into an organism capable of perceiving
/acting, then, yes, that organism would eprceive injury.
 But in this case, the second ingredient, the ability to avoid danger, is
 absent.
 There's nothing in particular that some (Atomese) organism can 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

run away from
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 a virus infestation.
 It would have to already be human-level intelligence to perceive this in
 generality, and we're currently talking about jelly-fish level intelligence.
 Jellyfish can perceive predators, and run away from them.
 Jellyfish can heal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At any rate, this is where 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

evil
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 comes from in our physical universe.
 Biological systems sense injury and pain, are aware of it.
 The physical universe is stuff with things that cause injury to biological
 systems.
 The combination of these two is means that evil occurs naturally in our
 physical universe.
 More: it can be described axiomatically, in probably under a dozen, maybe
 two dozen axioms.
 No need for god.
 So, now lets see what wikipedia says about this...
